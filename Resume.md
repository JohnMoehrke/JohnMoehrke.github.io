## Summary

Distinguished Interoperability Architect and recognized security and privacy expert with many years of experience enabling privacy-respecting Health Information Exchange and secure data use across global healthcare systems.

**Standards Leadership:** Co-Chair of HL7 Security Working Group and IHE IT-Infrastructure, driving the development of international healthcare interoperability standards. Author and editor of numerous international and regional **Implementation Guides** (IG) that shape global healthcare data exchange, including FHIR security frameworks and privacy consent models.

**Systems Design:** Specializes in orchestrating secure data movement between stakeholder systems while ensuring efficient, effective, and accurate processes. Expert in translating complex standards into practical frameworks that support regulatory compliance and trusted communications across health systems. 

**Use of Standards:** Aided [MyHealtheVet](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home) with the use of standards to benefit the [7 million Veteran patients that use it](https://www.va.gov/health/survey.asp#:~:text=VA%20Survey%20of%20Veteran%20Enrollees,My%20HealtheVet). First, with use of health information exchange interface to the nationwide health exchange, and enabling the Veteran to Consent or Dissent using FHIR Consent resource. Second, empowering the Veteran to report their own measurements for various vital-signs using FHIR. Finally, enabled transition from proprietary database to open source HAPI FHIR Server; using profiled and mapped FHIR Resources aligned with FHIR us-core. Other FHIR transitions are in the development queue.
