        Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) is an international
        initiative to promote the use of standards to achieve
        interoperability among health information technology (HIT)
        systems and effective use of electronic health records (EHRs).
        IHE provides a forum for care providers, HIT experts and other
        stakeholders in several clinical and operational domains to
        reach consensus on standards-based solutions to critical
        interoperability issues.
      </para>
      <para>
        The primary output of IHE is system implementation guides,
        called IHE profiles. IHE publishes each profile through a
        well-defined process of public review and Trial Implementation
        and gathers profiles that have reached Final Text status into an
        IHE Technical Framework, of which this volume is a part.

      <title>Introduction to IHE IT Infrastructure (ITI) Technical
      Framework</title>
      <para>
        This document, the IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework
        (ITI TF), defines specific implementations of established
        standards to achieve integration goals that promote appropriate
        sharing of medical information to support optimal patient care.
        It is expanded annually, after a period of public review, and
        maintained regularly through the identification and correction
        of errata. The latest version of the document is always
        available at

      </para>
      <para>
        The IHE IT Infrastructure Technical Framework identifies a
        subset of the functional components of the healthcare
        enterprise, called IHE actors, and specifies their interactions
        in terms of a set of coordinated, standards-based transactions.
        It describes this body of transactions in progressively greater
        depth. The present volume (ITI TF-1) provides a high-level view
        of IHE functionality, showing the transactions organized into
        functional units called integration profiles that highlight
        their capacity to address specific IT Infrastructure
        requirements.

    <title>IT Infrastructure Integration Profiles</title>
    <para>
      IHE IT Infrastructure Integration Profiles (Figure 2-1), offer a
      common language that healthcare professionals and vendors can use
      to discuss integration needs of healthcare enterprises and the
      integration capabilities of information systems in precise terms.
      Integration Profiles specify implementations of standards that are
      designed to meet identified clinical needs. They enable users and
      vendors to state which IHE capabilities they require or provide,
      by reference to the detailed specifications of the IHE IT
      Infrastructure Technical Framework.
    </para>
    <para>
      Integration profiles are defined in terms of IHE actors and
      transactions. Actors (see ITI TF-1: Appendix A) are information
      systems or components of information systems that produce, manage,
      or act on information associated with clinical and operational
      activities in the enterprise. Transactions (see ITI TF-1: Appendix
      B) are interactions between actors that communicate the required
      information through standards-based messages.
    </para>
    <para>
      Vendor products support an Integration Profile by implementing the
      appropriate actor(s) and transactions. A given product may
      implement more than one actor and more than one integration
      profile.

      <title>Dependencies among Integration Profiles</title>
      <para>
        Dependencies among IHE Integration Profiles exist when
        implementation of one integration profile is a prerequisite for
        achieving the functionality defined in another integration
        profile. Figure 2-1 provides a graphical view of the
        dependencies among IHE IT Infrastructure Integration Profiles.
        The arrows in the figure point from a given integration profile
        to the integration profile(s) upon which it depends. Table 2-1
        defines these dependencies in tabular form.
      </para>
      <para>
        Some dependencies require that an actor supporting one profile
        be grouped with one or more actors supporting other integration
        profiles. For example, Enterprise User Authentication (EUA)
        requires that different participating actors be grouped with the
        Time Client that participates in the Consistent Time (CT)
        Integration Profile. The dependency exists because EUA actors
        must refer to consistent time in order to function properly.

        These requirements are presented in the form of a table of
        transactions required for each actor supporting the Integration
        Profile. Actors supporting multiple Integration Profiles are
        required to support all the required transactions of each
        Integration Profile supported. When an Integration Profile
        depends upon another Integration Profile, the transactions
        required for the dependent Integration Profile have not been

        Note that IHE Integration Profiles are not statements of
        conformance to standards, and IHE is not a certifying body.
        Users should continue to request that vendors provide statements
        of their conformance to standards issued by relevant standards
        bodies, such as HL7 and

      <para>
        Also note that there are critical requirements for any
        successful integration project that IHE cannot address.
        Successfully integrating systems still requires a project plan
        that minimizes disruptions and describes fail-safe strategies,
        specific and mutually understood performance expectations,
        well-defined user interface requirements, clearly identified
        systems limitations, detailed cost objectives, plans for
        maintenance and support, etc.

      <title>Retrieve Information for Display Process Flow</title>
      <para>
        This section describes the process and information flow when
        displayable patient information is retrieved from an information
        source. Three cases are distinguished.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Case 1</emphasis>-Retrieve
        <emphasis>Specific</emphasis> Information for Display: The first
        case describes use cases when the Display and the person
        associated are requesting some information related to a patient.
        A somewhat specific request for information is issued (e.g.,
        Retrieve a summary of laboratory reports) for a specific Patient
        ID to an Information Source. The patient ID is assumed to be
        unambiguous as fully qualified with the assigning authority. A
        number of additional filtering keys may be used (last N reports,
        date range, etc.) depending on the specific type of request
        issued. The Information Source responds with presentation-ready
        information that it considers relevant to the request. This
        integration profile leaves entire flexibility to the Information
        Source to organize the content and presentation of the
        information returned. The Display simply displays the
        information to the person that triggered the request. The
        Information Source shall respond with an error message when it
        does not support the specific type of request or does not hold
        any records for the requested patient ID.

      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Case 2</emphasis> - Retrieve a Document:
        The second case describes use cases when the Display and the
        person associated are requesting a uniquely identified document
        such as a report, an image, an ECG strip, etc. The Information
        Source responds to the request by using one of the proposed
        formats to provide the presentation-ready content of the object
        it manages. The detailed presentation and the clinical integrity
        of the content of the document are under the control of the
        Information Source Actor. The Display simply displays the
        presentation-ready document content to the person that triggered
        the request. The Information Source shall respond with an error
        message when the requested document is unknown or when none of
        the formats acceptable to the Display is suitable to present the
        requested document.
      </para>
      <para>
        The main difference between the Retrieve
        <emphasis>Specific</emphasis> Information and the Retrieve
        <emphasis>Document</emphasis> transactions is that the latter
        applies to a uniquely identifiable persistent object (i.e.,
        retrieving the same document instance at a different point in
        time will provide the same semantics for its presented content).
        For the Retrieve Specific Information transaction, this
        information is always related to a well-identified patient
        (Patient ID), but its content, although of a specific type (lab
        summary, or radiology summary, list of allergies) is generally
        dynamic (i.e., retrieving the same type of specific information
        at a different point in time is likely to result in different
        content; for example, a list of allergies may have been updated
        between two requests).

        cases above with the capability to associate in sequence the
        Retrieve Specific Information and the Retrieve Document for
        Display transactions. This allows for links to persistent
        documents within the returned specific information or for having
        persistent documents reference other persistent documents. For
        example, the user requests a summary of recent discharge
        reports, and then selects a specific document referenced in that
        summary list. From the discharge report displayed to the user,
        the user selects a specific surgery report. This surgery report
        is retrieved and displayed.

        The same Display may involve more than one Information Source by
        sequentially issuing different transactions. This Integration
        Profile assumes that the Display Actors may be configured a
        priori with one or more remote Information Source Actors along
        with the type of retrieve transactions/type of requests/specific
        keys suitable for the application context from which this
        Retrieve Information for Display requests are issued. Future
        Integration Profiles may facilitate such site-specific
        configuration tasks.

      It greatly facilitates centralized user authentication management
      and provides users with the convenience and speed of a single
      sign-on. This profile leverages Kerberos (RFC1510) and the HL7
      CCOW standard (user subject). User authentication is a necessary
      step for most application and data access operations and it is a
      workflow improvement for the users. The IHE EUA Profile adds value
      to the CCOW specification for the user subject by specifying the
      user subject and CCOW user subject suffix. This profile does not
      address security features such as audit trails, access control,
      authorization management and PKI. Future profiles will be
      developed to address these security features in a manner
      complementary to this EUA Profile.

        A number of transactions used in this profile conform to the
        Kerberos v5 standard, defined in RFC1510. This standard has been
        stable since 1993, is widely implemented on current operating
        system platforms, has successfully withstood attacks in its
        10-year history, and is fully interoperable among platforms. For
        example, Sun Solaris, Linux, AIX, HPUX, IBM-z/OS, IBM-OS400,
        Novell, MAC OS X, and Microsoft Windows 2000/XP all implement
        Kerberos in an interoperable manner. This is not a complete
        list; many other vendors also support Kerberos.

      </para>
      <para>
        CCOW facilitates the sharing of the identity of a EUA
        authentication user but does not provide for the authentication
        of users. In order for the Context Manager and User Context
        Participant to participate in the EUA Profile it is required
        that the Client Authentication Agent supports the Authentication
        for User Option. This design provides the User Context
        Participant with a consistent and enterprise recognized user
        identity, but does not define access to the Kerberos
        credentials. Future IHE profiles may address this limitation.
        Note that the Client Authentication Agent is the key actor when
        PSA and EUA are combined. See the use case outlined in Section
        4.3.2. Applications that implement both the Client
        Authentication Agent and the User Context Participant shall
        support configurations where either actor is disabled.
      </para>
      <para>
        In any single user environment, there shall be only one Client
        Authentication Agent for one user. In a multi-user environment
        there shall not be more than one Client Authentication Agent per
        user.

            The user begins the session. This initiates a local
            username/password authentication that is converted into the
            challenge/response system used by Kerberos to avoid
            transmitting the password over the network. This information
            is used as part of the Get User Authentication Transaction
            to get a “Ticket Granting Ticket” (TGT).
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            The TGT is saved and managed internally by the Client
            Authentication Agent Actor. The TGT acts as confirmation
            that the user has been authenticated.

            For each service that has been Kerberized, the Client
            Authentication Agent uses the Get Service Ticket Transaction
            to obtain a service ticket. The service ticket is then used
            as part of the Kerberized Communication Transaction.
          </para>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
        A Kerberized Communication is a Kerberos data exchange that is
        integrated into another protocol, such as HL7 or DICOM, which is
        used in another IHE transaction. The details of Kerberization
        vary and are described separately for the protocols that have
        been Kerberized. The Kerberization enables the other IHE Actors
        involved in the other transaction to use the identity of the
        authenticated user for purposes such as user authorization or
        audit messages.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Client Authentication Agent also maintains an internal cache
        of credentials such as the TGT and service tickets. It renews
        the tickets as necessary to deal with ticket expirations,
        re-uses tickets while they are still valid, and removes
        credentials from the cache when the user session ends. The
        Client Authentication Agent shall make the Kerberos credentials
        available using the local operating system mechanisms. Other IHE
        Actors that need the Kerberos credentials are strongly
        encouraged to obtain them using the local operating system
        mechanisms. Operating system support for ticket management has
        been implemented and has been defined for various operating
        systems.

          The use model in the clinical environment can be characterized
          as multiple clinicians using the same workstation for short
          intervals of time many times a day. In this shared workstation
          environment, the user requires quick access to the patient
          data contained in the applications. Traditional methods of
          logging in and out of the workstation at the operating system
          or network level can take too long and typically force the
          applications to terminate. This means that the application
          clients will potentially need to initialize and establish new
          database connections, introducing further delay to the
          Clinician access to patient data. The CCOW standard and more
          specifically the “user” subject provides a means in
          combination with the Enterprise Authenticator to allow the
          user to authenticate at the application level and have all of
          the other applications tune to the new user.

          Clinician B approaches the workstation and authenticates using

          change from Clinician A to Clinician B being set in context
          without the delay typically associated with a logout and login
          at the operating system level. The clinical data repository
          and the cardiology application are notified of the context
          change by the Context Manager resulting in Clinician A being
          logged out of both applications and Clinician B being logged
          into both applications.

        <para>
          Clinician B does his job and then closes the clinical data

          Clinician B is finished reviewing patient data within the

      By specifying the above transactions among specific actors, this

      policies or cross-referencing algorithms. By encapsulating these

      necessary interoperability while maintaining the flexibility to be
      used with any cross-referencing policy and algorithm as deemed
      adequate by the enterprise.

      The diagram illustrates two types of Identifier Domains: a Patient
      Identifier Domain and a Patient Identifier Cross-reference Domain.
    </para>
    <para>
      A Patient Identifier Domain is defined as a single system or a set
      of interconnected systems that all share a common identification
      scheme (an identifier and an assignment process to a patient) and
      issuing authority for patient identifiers. Additionally, a Patient
      Identifier Domain has the following properties:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A set of policies that describe how identities will be defined

        <para>
          A <emphasis role="strong">single</emphasis> system, known as a
          patient identity source system, that assigns a unique
          identifier to each instance of a patient-related object as
          well as maintaining a collection of identity traits.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>

          Ideally, only one identifier is uniquely associated with a
          single patient within a given Patient Identifier Domain,
          though a single Patient Identity Source may assign multiple
          identifiers to the same patient and communicate this fact to
          the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. For a
          description of how the Patient Identifier Cross-reference
          Manager responds to requests for a list of cross-referenced
          identifiers that include these “duplicates” see ITI TF-2a:
          3.9.4.2.2.6).

    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      A Patient Identifier Cross-reference Domain consists of a set of
      Patient Identifier Domains known and managed by a Patient
      Identifier Cross-reference Manager Actor. The Patient Identifier
      Cross-reference Manager is responsible for creating, maintaining
      and providing lists of identifiers that are aliases of one another
      across different Patient Identifier Domains.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Patient Identifier Cross-reference Domain embodies the
      following assumptions about agreement within the group of
      individual Identifier Domains:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          They have agreed to a set of policies that describe how
          patient identities will be cross-referenced across
          participating domains;
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          They have agreed to a set of processes for administering these
          policies;
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          They have agreed to an administration authority for managing
          these processes and policies.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      All these assumptions are critical to the successful
      implementation of this profile. This integration profile imposes
      minimal constraints on the participating Patient Identifier
      Domains and centralizes most of the operational constraints for
      the overall Patient Identification Cross-reference Domain in the
      Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager Actor. If the
      individual Identifier Domains cannot agree to the items outlined
      above, implementation of this profile may not provide the expected
      results.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is not responsible
      for improving the quality of identification information provided
      to it by the Identity Source Actors. It is assumed that the
      Identity Source Actors are responsible for providing high quality
      data to the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. For
      example, the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager is NOT
      responsible to provide a single reference for patient
      demographics. The intent is to leave the responsibility for the
      quality and management of its patient demographics information and
      the integrity of the identifiers it uses within each Patient
      Identity Domain (Source actors). <emphasis role="strong">When
      receiving reports and displays from multiple PIX domains, it is
      inevitable that some of those reports and displays will have
      inconsistent names.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      The Patient Identifier Cross-reference Consumer may use either a
      query for sets of cross-reference patient identifiers or use both
      a notification about cross-reference changes and a query
      transaction. In the case of using a notification, the Patient
      Identifier Cross-reference Consumer may also use the PIX Query
      Transaction to address situations where the Patient Identifier
      Cross-reference Consumer may be out of synch with the Patient
      Identifier Cross-reference Manager. This Integration Profile does
      not specify the consumer policies in using the PIX Query
      Transaction (ITI TF-2a: 3.9).

          The experience of immunization registries and other public
          health population databases has shown that matching and
          linking patient records from different sources for the same
          individual person in environments with large proportions of
          pediatric records requires additional demographic data.
        </para>
        <para>
          In particular, distinguishing records for children who are
          twins, triplets, etc. – that is, avoiding false positive
          matches - may be difficult because much of the demographic
          data for the two individuals matches. For instance, twin
          children may have identical last names, parents, addresses,
          and dates of birth; their first names may be very similar,
          possibly differing by only one letter. It can be very
          difficult for a computer or even a human being to determine in
          this situation whether the slight first name difference points
          to two distinct individuals or just a typographical error in
          one of the records. Additional information is extremely
          helpful in making this determination.

          Pediatric Demographics makes use of the following six

                  and birth order are not collected. They indirectly
                  provide visit information. Provider visits on the same

        <para>
          A clinician in the Intensive Care Unit at General Hospital is
          reviewing a patient chart on the Intensive Care information
          system and wishes to review or monitor the patient’s glucose
          level, which is included in a laboratory report stored in the
          hospital’s main laboratory system. The Intensive Care system
          needs to map its own patient ID, which it generates
          internally, to the patient’s medical record number (MRN),
          which is generated from the hospital’s main ADT system and is
          used as the patient identity by the lab system. In this case
          the Intensive Care system is essentially in a different
          identifier domain than the rest of the hospital since it has
          its own notion of patient identity.
        </para>
        <para>
          In this scenario, the hospital’s main ADT system (acting as a
          Patient Identity Source) would provide a Patient Identity Feed
          (using the patient’s MRN as the identifier) to the Patient
          Identifier Cross-reference Manager. Similarly, the Intensive
          Care system would also provide a Patient Identity Feed to the
          Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager using the
          internally generated patient ID as the patient identifier and
          providing its own unique identifier domain identifier.
        </para>
        <para>
          Once the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager receives
          the Patient Identity Feed transactions, it performs its
          internal logic to determine which, if any, patient identifiers
          can be “linked together” as being the same patient based on
          the corroborating information included in the Feed
          transactions it has received. The cross-referencing process
          (algorithm, human decisions, etc.) is performed within the
          Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager and is outside the
          scope of IHE. (See ITI TF-2a: 3.9.4.2.2.6 for a more complete
          description of the scope of the cross-referencing logic
          boundary).
        </para>
        <para>
          The Intensive Care system wants to get lab information
          associated with a patient that the Intensive Care system knows
          as patient ID = ‘MC-123’. It requests the lab report from the
          lab system using its own patient ID (MC-123) including the
          domain identifier/ assigning authority. Upon receipt of the
          request, the lab system determines that the request is for a
          patient outside of its own identifier domain (ADT Domain). It
          requests a list of patient ID aliases corresponding to patient
          ID = ‘MC-123’ (within the “Intensive Care domain”) from the
          Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager. Having linked this
          patient with a patient known by medical record number = ‘007’
          in the ‘ADT Domain’, the Patient Identifier Cross-reference
          Manger returns this list to the lab system so that it may
          retrieve the lab report for the desired patient and return it
          to the Intensive Care system. Figure 5.3-1 illustrates this
          process flow.

          A healthcare enterprise is established by the consolidation of
          two hospitals, each having its own separate patient
          registration process run by different hospital information
          systems. When a patient is treated in one hospital, the access
          to its electronic records managed by the other hospital is
          necessary. The following use case illustrates this scenario.
        </para>
        <para>
          Hospitals A and B have been consolidated and have a single
          Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager that maintains the
          ID links between the two hospitals. Each hospital has a
          different HIS that is responsible for registering patients,
          but they have consolidated their cardiology information
          systems. The cardiology system has been configured with a
          Patient Identifier Cross-reference Consumer to receive patient
          identity notifications when cross-referencing activity occurs.
        </para>
        <para>
          A patient is registered and then has some diagnostic stress
          tests done at hospital A. The cardiology information system
          queries the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager to get
          a list of possible ID aliases for the patient to see if any
          past cardiology reports may be available. No patient ID
          aliases are found. Sometime later the same patient goes to
          hospital B to have a second diagnostic stress test done. The
          patient is registered via the HIS in hospital B which then
          sends that identity information to the Patient Identifier
          Cross-reference Manager. The Patient Identifier
          Cross-reference Manager determines this is in fact the same
          patient as was registered previously at hospital A. The
          cardiology information system was previously configured with
          the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager to receive
          notifications; thus a notification is sent to the cardiology
          system to inform it of the patient identifier aliases. This
          notification is done to allow systems that are aware of
          multiple identifier domains to maintain synchronization with
          patient identifier changes that occur in any of the identifier
          domains that they are aware of.

          <para>
            A regional Immunization Information System (IIS) receives
            birth registry information about a pair of twins. These
            twins are named “Lalainne” and “Lalannie” Smith. All of the
            data elements in the received registration are populated,
            and they are all identical, except for the Given Name, the
            Birth Order, and the Birth Certificate #. The IIS
            cross-referencing system can clearly identify this very
            similar data as belonging to two separate individuals,
            because they are both flagged as having been part of a
            Multiple Birth, their Birth Order numbers are different, and
            their Birth Certificate #s are different.

          <para>
            A couple years later, the mother of these two twins, who has
            now divorced and remarried, takes them to Pediatric
            Healthcare, where they get the immunizations appropriate for
            2-year olds. Pediatric Healthcare completes a registration
            for each of them, and submits the resulting data to the IIS.
            This data has their new Family Name as “Gomez,” but the
            clerks had appropriately recorded the Birth Order of each
            twin. Again, the IIS was able to distinguish the two
            registration records as belonging to separate individuals,
            and it was able to match them up to their earlier records
            because the mother’s Maiden Name was present in both the
            earlier records and the records submitted from Pediatric
            Healthcare. Pediatric Healthcare was able to download the
            full immunization history of each twin.

          <title>5.3.3.3 Use Case: Minimal Demographic Feed from a
          Health Fair</title>
          <para>
            The Jackson County Health Department puts on an annual
            Health Fair in a shopping mall every August, partly to
            screen school age children for the minimum shots required
            for admission to the first grade. Mrs. Gomez is now working
            to pay for her new apartment, but her sister-in-law takes
            the children to the Health Fair where they are given shots
            based on the paper “yellow card” the sister-in-law brings
            with the two twins. Jackson County Health Department staff
            records the children’s names, and the shots they were given.
            This information is entered into the computer back at the
            Clinic the next day, and submitted to the regional IIS.
          </para>
          <para>
            At this point, even though both children’s names were
            misspelled as “Lane” and “Lanna”, the Immunization Registry
            was again able to recognize that the records belonged to
            twins rather than the same person because, although the
            demographic data was almost identical, the Last Update
            Date/Time were very close (Date was the same) and Last
            Update Facility indicated the same clinic. Unfortunately,
            they didn’t write down the mother’s information at the
            Health Fair, but recorded her sister-in-law’s name and
            address instead, so the Immunization Registry was not able
            to automatically link this new information to the
            information it already had for “Lalainne” and “Lalannie”.

          <para>
            A better outcome could have happened if the clinic had
            recorded any one of several different data elements that
            would have helped tie this new data to the previous data.
            Any one of the Mothers Maiden Name (even the Mother’s First
            Name component), the Home Phone Number, or the unique
            identifier for the kids which was printed on the “yellow
            card” from Pediatric Healthcare would have helped.

      <title>Relationship between the PIX Integration Profile and eMPI
      </title>
      <para>
        The PIX Integration Profile achieves the integration of
        disparate Patient Identifier Domains by using a
        cross-referencing approach between Patient Identifiers
        associated with the same patient. This section discusses how
        this approach is compatible with environments that wish to
        establish master patient identifiers (MPI), or enterprise MPI
        (eMPI) systems. An eMPI may be considered a particular variation
        in implementation of the PIX Integration Profile.
      </para>
      <para>
        The concept of an MPI is a rather broad concept, yet it is most
        often associated with the creation of a master patient
        identifier domain. Such a master domain is considered more
        broadly applicable or more “enterprise-level” than the other
        patient identifier domains it includes. Such a hierarchical
        inclusion of patient identification domains into a “master
        patient identification domain” can be considered a particular
        case of patient cross-reference, where the patient identifiers
        in the various domains are cross-referenced to the patient
        identifiers of the master domain. Two possible configurations
        are depicted by Figure 5.4-1.
      </para>
      <para>
        Figure 5.4-1: PIX Profile Relationship to eMPI
      </para>
      <para>
        Figure 5.4-1 above shows how the Master Patient Identifier
        Domain (Domain C), in a typical MPI approach, is simply another
        patient Identification Domain when considered in a
        Cross-referencing approach. The decision to place
        enterprise-wide systems such as Clinical Data Repositories into
        the so-called master domain is simply a configuration choice. In
        addition, such a configuration sometimes assumes that any system
        in Patient Domain A not only manages the patient Identifiers of
        Domain A but is also aware of those of Domain C. In the Patient
        Identifier Cross-reference Integration Profile, this is a
        configuration choice where certain systems have been designed
        and configured to operate across multiple domains. Thus the
        entity often called an MPI (shown by the oval) is actually the
        combination of a Patient Identity Source (ADT) along with a
        Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager.
      </para>
      <para>
        The PIX Integration Profile can coexist with environments that
        have chosen to deploy a distinct MPI, and provides a more
        scalable approach. Many other configurations can also be
        deployed, in particular those where the creation of a master
        domain “including” the other domains is not necessary (i.e., a
        simple federation of domains where none is actually the master).

      This profile leverages the HL7 CCOW standard, specifically for
      patient subject context management. The scope of this profile is
      for sharing of the CCOW Patient subject only. The IHE PSA Profile
      adds value to the CCOW specification for the patient subject by
      further constraining the patient identifier to ensure consistency
      across applications supporting PSA, providing guidance for
      consistent behavior across applications supporting PSA and
      ensuring consistent interaction with the Patient Identifier
      Cross-reference Consumer across the enterprise.

      For applications that require user authentication, IHE recommends
      implementation of the Enterprise User Authentication Profile, as

      several of the profiles in the IHE IT Infrastructure and will also
      be needed by Cardiology. It is therefore being re-located from IHE
      Radiology into IHE IT Infrastructure. There are no changes to the
      requirements, so actors that supported the Radiology Basic Secure
      Node or Time Server do not need modification.

        The NTP protocol has been designed to provide network time
        services for synchronization with this kind of cascaded
        synchronization. The achievable accuracy is dependent on
        specific details of network hardware and topology, and on
        details of computer hardware and software implementation. The
        Time Server and Time Client are grouped to provide
        synchronization cascading and reduce network traffic.

                  provide visit information. Provider visits on the same

        <para>
          When an implementation supports a Secure Node, Secure
          Application or Audit Record Repository, the ATNA requirements
          – node authentication, user authentication, access control,
          event logging, and other security rules -- apply to all of the
          actors in the implementation.

          <title>9.1.1.1 Secure Node</title>
          <para>
            A Secure Node is a system that provides security and privacy
            services (user authentication, secure communications,
            security audit recording, and security policy enforcement)
            for all software and services on that system. An ultrasound
            machine is an example of a Secure Node.
          </para>
          <para>
            Security services apply to all aspects of the system from
            the hardware up to the user interface and external
            communication. A Secure Node has control over this entire
            stack, and ensures that all aspects are covered by the
            security and privacy services. A Secure Node vendor does not
            need to invent its own disk drives or write its own
            operating system. Contractual control over security is
            sufficient. A short list of exceptions may exist if the risk
            analysis indicates that these are not significant and the
            full list of exceptions is documented.
          </para>
          <para>
            This permits cloud-based and other system architectures to
            claim to be a Secure Node when there are sufficient
            contractual controls to ensure that security and privacy
            services cover the entire relevant hardware and software
            stack. This includes any non-IHE applications that process
            PHI in that environment, such as database services.

      Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing is focused on providing a

      Within an XDS Affinity Domain, certain common policies and
      business rules must be defined. They include how patients are
      identified, consent is obtained, and access is controlled, as well
      as the format, content, structure, organization and representation
      of clinical information. This Integration Profile does not define
      specific policies and business rules; however, it has been
      designed to accommodate a wide range of such policies to
      facilitate the deployment of standards-based infrastructures for
      sharing patient clinical documents. This is managed through
      federated document repositories and a document registry to create
      a longitudinal record of information about a patient within a
      given XDS Affinity Domain. These are distinct entities with
      separate responsibilities:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A document repository is responsible for storing documents in

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          A document registry is responsible for storing information
          about those documents so that the documents of interest for
          the care of a patient may be easily found, selected and
          retrieved irrespective of the repository where they are
          actually stored.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      By specifying separate Document Registry and Document Repository
      Actors, XDS offers additional flexibility of having a single
      Document Registry index content for multiple Document
      Repositories. The ebRIM portion of the registry standard supports
      this possibility though the ExternalIdentifier object type, see
      ITI TF-3: 4.2.3.1.1. A Document Repository may hold documents that
      are not indexed in a Document Registry.
    </para>
    <para>
      The concept of a document in XDS is not limited to textual
      information. As XDS is document content neutral, any type of
      clinical information without regard to content and representation
      is supported. This makes the XDS IHE Integration Profile equally
      able to handle documents containing simple text, formatted text
      (<emphasis>e.g.,</emphasis> HL7 CDA Release 1), images
      (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, DICOM) or structured and vocabulary
      coded clinical information (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, CDA Release
      2, CCR, CEN ENV 13606, DICOM SR). In order to ensure the necessary
      interoperability between the document sources and the document
      consumers, the XDS Affinity Domain must adopt policies concerning
      document format, structure and content.
    </para>
    <para>
      The XDS Integration Profile is not intended to address all
      cross-enterprise EHR communication needs. Some scenarios may
      require the use of specific XDS options, the use of other IHE
      Integration profiles, such as Patient Identifier
      Cross-Referencing, Audit Trail and Node Authentication,
      Cross-Enterprise User Authentication, and Retrieve Information for
      Display. Other scenarios may be only partially supported, while
      still others may require future IHE Integration profiles, which
      will be defined by IHE as soon as the necessary base standards are
      available. Specifically:

    <orderedlist numeration="arabic">
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The sharing and access to dynamic information such as allergy
          lists, medication lists, problem lists, etc. is addressed in
          part by XDS through the aggregation of information across
          structured documents and in part by the XDS On-Demand
          Documents Option that provides support for requesting most
          recent computer assembled content. In addition, other IHE
          profiles such as Retrieve Information for Display Integration
          Profile provide complementary means to query a-priori known
          systems that may provide targeted dynamic information for a
          patient.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The placing and tracking of orders (e.g., drug prescriptions,
          radiology orders, etc.) is not supported by XDS. This does not
          preclude the use of XDS to store and register orders and
          corresponding results when such artifacts need to be recorded
          in the patient’s health record. However, XDS provides no
          facilities for tracking progress of an order through its
          workflow, and therefore is not intended for order management.
          A complementary approach to cross-enterprise order workflow
          (ePrescription, eReferral) may be expected as separate
          Integration Profiles in the future.

          The operation of any XDS Affinity Domain will require that a
          proper security model be put in place. It is expected that a
          range of security models should be possible. Although the XDS
          Integration Profile is not intended to include nor require any
          specific security model, it is expected that XDS implementers
          will group XDS actors with actors from the IHE Audit Trail and
          Node Authentication and will need an Access Control capability
          that operates in such a cross-enterprise environment. Specific
          IHE Integration Profiles complementary to XDS are available
          (e.g., Cross-Enterprise User Authentication, Document Digital
          Signature, etc.).

      <listitem>
        <para>
          The establishment of independent XDS Affinity Domains will
          call for their federation, as patients expect their records to
          follow them as they move from region to region, or country to
          country. IHE foresees a need for transferring information from
          one XDS Affinity Domain to another, or to allow access from
          one XDS Affinity Domain to documents managed in other XDS
          Affinity Domains. XDS has been designed with this extension in
          mind. The Cross-Community Access (XCA) Integration Profile
          that complements XDS provides this function.

          XDS does not address transactions for the management or
          configuration of an XDS Affinity Domain. For example, the
          configuration of network addresses or the definition of what
          type of clinical information is to be shared is specifically
          left up to the policies established by the XDS Affinity
          Domain.

          A Document Repository initiates the Register Document Set
          transaction. This transaction allows a Document Repository to
          register one or more documents with a Document Registry, by
          supplying metadata about each document to be registered. This
          document metadata will be used to create an XDS Document Entry
          in the registry. The Document Registry ensures that document
          metadata is valid before allowing documents to be registered.
          If one or more documents fail the metadata validation, the
          Register Document Set transaction fails as a whole.

          The Registry Stored Query transaction is issued by the

          The Patient Identity Feed Transaction conveys the patient
          identifier and corroborating demographic data, captured when a
          patient’s identity is established, modified or merged or in
          cases where the key corroborating demographic data has been
          modified. Its purpose in the XDS Integration Profile is to
          populate the registry with patient identifiers that have been
          registered for the XDS Affinity Domains.

          The Patient Identify Feed Transaction defined in ITI TF-2a:
          3.8 for HL7v2 and in ITI TF-2b: 3.44 for HL7v3 uses standard
          HL7 encoding of Patient Identifiers. This is standard encoding
          for HL7 applications; receiving applications are expected to
          extract the required data for their use.
        </para>
        <para>
          When combined with the other XDS transactions, Document
          Registry Actors and other actors that receive HL7 data with
          Patient Identifiers are required to map the data received in
          the HL7 message to the format specified in those other XDS
          transactions. In those transactions, the Patient ID is treated
          using ebXML encoding rules and not HL7 encoding rules.
          Specifically, the Patient ID will be treated as a string, and
          extra components entered in that string shall cause those
          transactions to fail. XDS actors are required to use the
          specified encoding for Patient ID values in other transactions
          and not merely copy the value received in an HL7 transaction.

          of HL7 implemented by XDS.b and Patient Identity Feed in a
          single domain or community need to match in order to allow
          interoperability. In the case of mixed scenarios, translation
          between Patient Identity Feed (ITI TF-2a: 3.8) and Patient
          Identity Feed HL7v3 (ITI TF-2b: 3.44) will be required via a

          An XDS Document is the smallest unit of information that may

          entry in the Document Registry Actor.
        </para>
        <para>
          An XDS Document is a composition of clinical information that
          contains observations and services for the purpose of exchange
          with the following characteristics: Persistence, Stewardship,
          Potential for Authentication, and Wholeness. These
          characteristics are defined in the HL7 Clinical Document
          Architecture specification. An XDS Document may be human
          readable (with the appropriate application). In any case, it
          should comply with a published standard defining its
          structure, content and encoding. IHE intends to define
          content-oriented Integration Profiles relying on such content
          standards to be used in conjunction with XDS.
        </para>
        <para>
          The XDS Integration Profile manages XDS Documents as a single
          unit of information; it does not provide mechanisms to access
          portions of an XDS Document. Only the Document Sources or
          Document Consumers have access to the internal information of
          the XDS Document. When submitted for sharing, an XDS Document
          is provided to the Document Repository as an octet stream.
          When retrieved through the Retrieve Document Set transaction,
          it shall be unchanged from the octet stream that was
          submitted.

          The Document Source is responsible for producing the metadata
          that will be submitted to the Document Registry to form the
          XDS Document Entry that will be used for query purposes by XDS
          Consumer Actors. The Document Source maintains
          responsibilities over the XDS Documents it has registered. It
          shall replace XDS Documents that may have been submitted in

          request that includes two new documents, a reference to a
          pre-existing document and the use of two folders. The first

          The XDS Integration Profile provides a means to place
          documents in a repository chosen by the Document Source, and

          The term metadata reflects that this information is “about”
          the documents. The purpose of well-specified document metadata
          is to enable a uniform mechanism for Document Consumers to

          An “approved” XDS Document may be changed to “deprecated”. It
          is part of security policies that are beyond the scope of the
          XDS Profile to have the XDS Repository/Registry enforce this
          ownership. The reason and responsible party for deprecating a
          document are tracked as part of the XDS Document Registry
          audit trail, which is a required capability. A “deprecated”
          Document remains available for Document Consumer queries.
          Except for the status change, a “deprecated” Document Entry
          metadata remains the same as when it was in the “approved”
          status.

          An “approved” or “deprecated” XDS Document Entry may be
          deleted. This change is associated with the decision to
          completely remove a Document from an XDS Document Repository
          and the corresponding Document Entry from the XDS Document
          Registry. The XDS Affinity Domain shall establish the security
          policies associated with Document deletion. There are no

            These relationships between XDS Documents are tracked in the
            XDS Document Registry. The parent relationship attribute
            contained in the metadata of such Documents is a coded value
            that describes the type of relationship. An original
            Document has no parent and consequently its parent Id and
            parent relationship are absent. XDS Document Registry shall
            reject submissions that contain relationships to documents
            that are not registered or have been “deprecated”. Document
            stubs are supported by XDS to allow for a valid relationship
            to a known but not registered Document.
          </para>
          <para>
            A replacement document is a new version of an existing
            document. The replacement document has a new document Id;
            its parent Id attribute contains the document Id of the
            Document Entry associated with the previous version of the
            XDS Document, and parent relationship contains the code
            “RPLC”. The Document Entry for the previous version shall
            have its Availability Status changed to “deprecated”.
          </para>
          <para>
            Replacement of On-Demand Document Entries works exactly the
            same as replacing Stable Document Entries in that the new
            entry is marked Approved and the replaced entry is marked
            Deprecated. But an On-Demand Document Entry which has been
            replaced cannot be expected to provide content that is
            current, so the On-Demand Document Source may return an
            error if a Retrieve Document Set request is received with a
            uniqueID for a deprecated entry.
          </para>
          <para>
            An addendum is a separate XDS Document that references a
            prior document, and may extend or alter the observations in
            the prior document. It modifies the parent document, but the
            parent document remains a valid component of the patient
            record and shall remain in the state “approved” or available
            for care. The addendum XDS Document metadata contains the
            identifier of the previous XDS Document version in parent
            Id, and its parent relationship contains the code “APND”.
          </para>
          <para>
            A transformed document is derived by a machine translation
            from some other format. Examples of transformed documents
            could be CDA documents converted from DICOM Structured
            Reporting (SR) reports, or a rendering of a report into a
            presentation format such as PDF. The transform XDS Document
            contains the document Id of the previous version in
            parentId, and its parent relationship contains the code
            “XFRM”. XDS Affinity Domains may define rules that determine
            whether or not a transformed XDS Document replaces the
            source, but typically this would not be the case. If it is,
            an additional parent relationship of type “RPLC” is to be
            used.

            environment of document sharing. To determine which type of
            XDS Document Entry should be used, an analysis of the

          <para>
            In this model, health data is published by a well-identified
            and responsible source (clinician, care delivery
            organization, individual consumer, etc.). The source
            determines when a meaningful collection of data should be
            published based on clinical events or other activities
            understood by the source and potential remote entities. The
            source publishes stable collections of data in the form of
            one or more documents, for potential use by other entities.
            Other entities access the documents by querying for a list
            of documents that have been published, and retrieving those
            that are of interest. Documents are source attested;
            consistency and wholeness is the responsibility of the
            source, which provides explicit context for each document
            (legal record keeping requirements). Complete documents are
            stored in repositories. If errors need to be corrected or
            updates are needed, they are the responsibility of the
            source. Entities accessing these records are offered trust
            guaranties equivalent or superior to paper records shared
            today.

          </para>
          <para>
            In this model, health data is still controlled by a
            well-identified and responsible source (clinician, care
            delivery organization, individual consumer, etc.) but that
            source does not maintain its content in the form of a
            document. Generally, content is stored as records in a
            clinical database and compiled into a document in response
            to a request. This type of source can be more efficient by
            using the inherent mechanism for marking content without
            forming it in a Document unless requested. To support these
            types of systems, XDS allows for deferral of the actual
            assembly of the document content until a Retrieve Document
            Set transaction requests it. Use of the Delayed Document
            Assembly Option should be limited to those organizations
            which need this performance enhancement, but in all other
            aspects are delivering and managing (e.g., need for
            corrections and updates) content in the same fashion as a
            Stable Document Entry.

          <para>
            As part of an extract from a health record, some documents,
            containing specific types of content, may be automatically
            generated with non-stable or dynamic content. These
            documents are “dynamic” in that each retrieval of the
            document may result in different content. Documents whose
            content is assembled at the time of retrieval have no
            inherent stable properties like persistence or stewardship.
            The wholeness of a dynamically created document will not be
            based on any clinician attestation and may require careful
            clinical interpretation depending on the content and the
            span of aggregation performed by the document authoring
            system. If the document authoring system originates from a
            single care delivery organization, context and wholeness may
            be quite good. If the aggregation was performed across
            multiple health delivery organizations, the aggregator may
            have difficulties assuming legal and clinical responsibility
            for the aggregated content. An example of a dynamically
            created document is a summary that collects information
            related to multiple healthcare events or on-going healthcare
            events.

            The use of Delayed Document Assembly allows some types of
            source systems to operate in a more efficient way than is
            supported prior to the introduction of this option. XDS is
            designed with the expectation that the document is entirely
            created prior to registering the metadata with the Document
            Registry. The use of Delayed Document Assembly allows source
            systems to register the existence of stable document content
            but defer actually assembling the document content only if
            and when it is retrieved. This deferral of the creation of
            the document content is preferred in an application
            architecture where a great deal of content is available for
            sharing but saved as a set of distinct elementary records in
            a clinical database and not as documents. To convert all
            this content to documents is considered a waste of resources
            for any document which is never requested. Thus, only
            content that is specifically requested is formed into a
            document.
          </para>
          <para>
            Delayed Document Assembly is distinct from On-Demand
            Documents in that Delayed Document Assembly is consistent
            with the current assumptions of XDS, namely that Document
            Entries in the Document Registry reflect Documents that are
            static, clinician attested documents and the content of the
            document is identified prior to registration of the Document
            Entry. On-Demand Documents allows the content of the
            document to be identified at the time of receipt of the
            retrieval request. Delayed Document Assembly has been
            designed to be as transparent as possible to Document
            Consumer Actors. Document Consumers Actors may easily
            support Stable Documents whose assembly has been delayed
            just as if they were a regular Stable Document since the
            only constraint on Document Consumers brought by this
            Delayed Document Assembly Option is to support responses to
            queries with the presence of Stable Document Entries that
            have zero size and hash values.

                The Document Consumer decides it requires this document

                query response. The Integrated Document
                Source/Repository uses the unique identifier specified
                in the Retrieve Document Set to identify which records
                in the clinical database were identified for this
                document at the time of registration. If new content
                became available after the registration of the document
                it will not be included in the document content. The

            The use of On-Demand Documents supports registration of the
            availability of dynamically assembled content, content that
            is expected to change over time, and in response to a
            retrieve request always returns the most current content
            available to the responder. The use of On-Demand Documents
            is intended for an application architecture where the
            supplier of data wishes to provide, through a single request
            mechanism, the most current knowledge available at the time
            of the request. Dynamically created content are services
            that present data in the form of documents using XDS and XCA
            transactions and infrastructure. The dynamic nature of the
            data means this environment is more complicated to support
            but allows easy access to, for instance, summary data for a
            specific patient. However, it does not provide for robust
            source attestation of the overall document content because
            the content is selected through automation rather than
            overseen and attested in whole by a clinician.

                The On-Demand Document Source registers an On-Demand
                Document Entry for a patient for which it maintains
                healthcare data. The On-Demand Document Entry describes
                what type of content will be returned and what format
                the content will be delivered in (e.g., XDS-MS patient
                summary). This On-Demand Document Entry is registered
                with the XDS Document Registry.

                A Document Consumer which supports access to On-Demand

                requesting that On-Demand Document Entries (possibly as
                well as other types of entries) be returned. The
                Document Registry returns the entries created by the
                On-Demand Document Source that match the query
                parameters.

                The Document Consumer uses the metadata from the
                On-Demand Document Entry to request the most recent
                content from the On-Demand Document Source. The
                On-Demand Document Source searches its clinical database
                for content of the type defined by the On-Demand
                Document Entry, formulates this into a document, and
                returns the document. If the Document Consumer repeats
                the request for data defined by the On-Demand Document
                Entry, the content returned on the second request may be
                different than the first due to updates to the
                underlying clinical database. The On-Demand Document
                Source may choose to register the document created as a
                consequence of the Document Consumer’s retrieve request,
                in which case it will group with a Document Source to
                register the newly created document. A special
                association is used to link the newly created document
                to the On-Demand Document Entry.

            of the EHR-LR. This range of implementation strategies
            reflects the need to accommodate a variety of workflows and
            configurations. These implementation strategies may coexist

      <title> Security Considerations</title>
      <para>
        Coordinating the security and privacy policies of all the care
        delivery organizations in an XDS Affinity Domain may be a
        challenge. An agreement is needed on security procedures, goals,
        auditing, record keeping, etc. This can result in changes to
        other enterprise policies, such as human resources procedures.
        XDS Affinity Domain members are trusting to some extent the
        access of their published data by other members of the XDS
        Affinity Domain. The level of control is dependent on Policies
        and application of other security and privacy profiles offered
        by IHE. This relationship requires a close ongoing partnership
        that ensures ongoing maintenance of policies, procedures, and
        activities. If laws change, relevant policies must be adjusted
        throughout the group. Corporate changes to group members affect
        the policies. Security events must be managed as a group. This
        must be managed as a long-term activity, not a one-time event.

          The XDS Profile requires all actors be grouped with a Secure

          The individual actors involved are often members of different

          transfers between different secure domains may need different
          protection than transfers within a secure domain. The use of
          encryption and other security mechanisms will depend upon the
          policies of the domains involved.
        </para>
        <para>
          Transfers within a single secure domain may choose to omit

      This Personnel White Pages Profile specifies a method of finding
      directory information on the User Identities (user@realm) supplied
      by the Enterprise User Authentication (EUA) Integration Profile.
      This Profile assumes but does not define access controls, and
      audit trails. The use of the PWP Profile is intended for use
      within a healthcare enterprise. Extension to support sharing of
      the PWP between healthcare enterprises is possible but not fully
      addressed by this profile. The PWP Profile is the first step on an
      IHE roadmap that includes Digital Certificates, Encryption,
      Digital Signatures, Medical Credentials, and Roles.

    <para>
      The directory need not support use cases beyond healthcare
      operations (e.g., Human Resource Operations), but does not forbid
      a properly designed overlap with other use cases. This profile
      does not intend for patients or other individuals that are not
      acting as part of the human healthcare workforce.

            the Personnel White Pages Directory. The clinical
            application then queries [ITI-24] the Personnel White Pages
            Directory using the user’s username and displays the user’s
            full name with First Name, Middle, and Last. There are

        The Cross-Enterprise User Assertion Profile (XUA) provides a
        means to communicate claims about an authenticated principal
        (user, application, system...) in transactions that cross
        enterprise boundaries. To provide accountability in these
        cross-enterprise transactions there is a need to identify the
        requesting user in a way that enables the receiver to make
        access decisions and proper audit entries. The XUA Profile
        supports many solutions including enterprises that have chosen
        to have their own user directory with their own unique method of
        authenticating the users, and others that have chosen to use a
        third party to perform the authentication.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are transactions defined by IHE that cross enterprise
        boundaries and are web-services based on ITI TF-2x: Appendix V.
        The existing IHE profiles for an authenticated user identity
        (IHE Enterprise User Authentication Profile (EUA)) are not
        intended to function in cross-enterprise transactions. In a
        cross-enterprise environment it is more likely that the
        transactions will be going between two enterprises that maintain
        their own independent user directories (IHE Personnel White
        Pages [PWP]). This type of requirement is the focus of the
        Identity Federation standards. Identity Federation has received
        much attention by the security and the platforms industry.
        Identity Federation is agnostic to the type of user directory;
        it allows for a centralized user directory, but also supports
        the more powerful federation of user directories. Identity
        Federation supports:

      <title>13.1 Use Cases</title>
      <para>
        The XUA Profile supports complex environments, for example one
        where two different trust domains are operating under different
        technology, procedures, role-models, etc. They are cooperating
        in the XDS Affinity domain under an overarching trust
        relationship policy (See ITI TF-2x: Appendix L) that indicates
        that these differences can be rationalized. The XDS transactions
        are transferring control from one entity to another, for
        example, when using XDS to exchange data between a single doctor
        practice and large multi-site hospital. It is not likely that
        they will all agree to the same access control model
        (organizational roles, functional roles, workflows, permissions,
        etc.). It is not necessary to have the same access control
        across these entities, but it is reasonable that at the policy
        level they will agree to a set of processing rules. This
        illustrates an important fact that the XUA is useful for
        security audit logging, but is to a lesser extent useful for
        access controls.

      <para>
        The vast majority of the use-cases (items 1-11) rely on claims
        about an authenticated identity, which a SAML 2.0 Identity
        Assertion can provide. This is a mature standard produced by
        OASIS. XUA Profile is focused on Web-Services transactions that
        follow ITI TF-2x: Appendix V. XUA specifies that when a
        Cross-Enterprise User Assertion is needed, these Web-Services
        transactions will additionally use the Web-Services Security
        header with a SAML 2.0 Token containing the identity Assertion.
        As with any IHE profile, the applications are not forbidden to
        use other methods of providing the principal (user) identity,
        providing that interoperability has been assured through some
        policy.
      </para>
      <para>
        A very clear need on all the use-cases is the recording of the
        user identity in any security audit logs. The XUA Profile does
        not define these auditable events. The need to record a security
        audit event is driven by the grouped transactions (e.g.,
        Registry Stored Query, and Retrieve Document Set). XUA does
        specify how to reference the Identity Assertion in an ATNA Audit
        Message.
      </para>
      <para>
        The method of authenticating the principal (user) and the method
        that the X-Service User (e.g., XDS.b Document Consumer) uses to
        get the Identity Assertion are outside the scope of this
        profile.
      </para>
      <para>
        There are principal (user) attributes that appear to be needed
        in the use-cases: Doctor, Patient, Guardian, Emergency-Access.
        The Identity Assertion can contain attributes about the
        principal (user). At this time it is not clear what standards to
        use to identify these attributes and their values, so this is
        left to specific implementations that have defined a local
        vocabulary or vocabulary translation.
      </para>
      <para>
        The method used by the X-Service User (e.g., XDS.b Document
        Consumer) to determine the contents of the Identity Assertion is
        outside the scope of this profile. This might be accomplished
        using the SAML Metadata and WS-Policy.

        <para>
          Role-Based-Access Control is a common architecture for
          managing and enforcing authorizations. In this model users are
          assigned to roles, and permissions are assigned to these
          roles. In this way the administration of permissions to users
          is grouped through roles. In an RBAC model these roles are
          well known and agreed to between the system that is managing
          users and the access control system. Given that a Federated
          Identity environment allows for a loose coupling of the
          Identity-Manager and the Access Control point, there is a need
          to have a well-defined vocabulary for the roles. This set of
          roles will likely expand over time and will be extended with
          local codes into a Value-Set within any specific
          Security-Domain.
        </para>
        <para>
          This option recommends that the Value-Set be derived from the
          role codes found in SNOMED-CT, ISO 21298, or ASTM E1986. The
          Value-Set used would bridge between different policy domain
          roles used in a client domain to those used in the service
          domain. In this way it is possible for local role definitions
          to be used as long as they can be bridged to the roles found
          in the selected Value-Set. Implementations should expect that
          the Value-Set used may be using locally defined values. The
          use of the IHE Sharing of Value-Sets (SVS) Profile may assist
          with this.

          There are transactions where the requester of the transaction
          knows of specific Consent/Authorization evidence that would
          enable that transaction. The identification could be used by
          the relying party Access Control engine as a hint. The Access
          Control engine could explicitly retrieve that specific object,
          validate that it is indeed a properly formed
          Consent/Authorization, and determine if that
          Consent/Authorization does indeed affect the Access Control
          decision.
        </para>
        <para>
          This can be used where the requester had previously published
          Consent/Authorization evidence Document but where this new
          knowledge had not yet propagated fully to the Access Control
          infrastructure. This mechanism is also useful where the
          requester is under regulatory obligations to include evidence

          Document. This option leverages the BPPC consent model.

          Access Control White Paper</link>, there are Access Control
          decisions that are based on the ultimate use of the data. For
          example, a Patient may have provided a BPPC
          Consent/Authorization for treatment purposes, but explicitly
          disallowed any use for research regardless of
          de-identification methods used. The purpose of use is also
          informative to the ATNA audit log to enable specific reporting
          of Accounting of Disclosures and Breach Notification. To
          enable this type of Audit Logging and Access Control decision
          there is a need to include in the XUA Assertion the intended
          purpose for which the data will be used. One specific purpose
          of use would be a Break-Glass / Emergency-Mode-Access.

          The X-Identity Assertion is valuable and must be protected
          against confidentiality risks. In some Profiles (e.g., XDS),
          there is already an inherited requirement to group with ATNA
          Secure Node or Secure Application Actor. This grouping forces
          the network transactions to utilize mutually authenticated and
          encrypted TLS or equivalent. This is leveraged by XUA to
          support the protection of the X-User Assertion to some risks
          to confidentiality and integrity. When ATNA Secure Node or
          Secure Application grouping is not required, there will need
          to be some other mechanism to protect the Provide X-User
          Assertion.

          pre-admitted in the hospital for relevant diagnostic tests.
          The tests confirm the condition, and the patient is admitted
          in the hospital's ICU. During the stay in the ICU, the
          patient's insurance is verified, and the updated information

      <para>
        Note 1: An IHE National Extension shall select at least one of
        the Merge and Link / Unlink Options, and shall mandate the same
        option for both the Patient Demographics Supplier and the
        Patient Demographics Consumer implementations in its realm to
        ensure interoperability.
      </para>
      <para>
        Note 2: The Pending Event Management Option depends on the
        Inpatient / Outpatient Encounter Management Option. An
        implementation supporting the Pending Event Management Option
        must also support the Inpatient / Outpatient Encounter
        Management Option.
      </para>
      <para>
        The PAM Profile offers a large number of options to support the
        exchange of patient demographic and encounter data in a wide
        variety of environments. Particularly, this profile addresses
        both acute care settings and ambulatory healthcare
        organizations. It is unlikely that one particular environment
        will need all the options.
      </para>
      <para>
        On one hand, an ambulatory care community might need only the
        pair of actors Patient Demographics Supplier/Patient
        Demographics Consumer, using transaction [ITI-30]. On the other
        hand, the exchange of patient demographic and encounter data
        between a hospital patient administration system and its
        ancillary systems (laboratory, radiology, cardiology, etc.)
        might be fully satisfied, for example, with the pair of actors
        Patient Encounter Supplier/Patient Encounter Consumer, using
        transaction [ITI-31] with the Basic Subset of messages and the
        two options “Inpatient/Outpatient Encounter Management” and
        “Maintain Demographics.”
      </para>
      <para>
        Hence, the first decision that must be made by a healthcare
        organization for the deployment of this profile is to select the
        proper actors and the appropriate set of options to cover its
        needs, ensuring that each selected option will be supported by
        the actors on both ends of the transactions.
      </para>
      <para>
        Furthermore, as an IT Infrastructure profile, the PAM Profile
        may not be used standalone. Rather, its actors and transactions
        will be leveraged by other domain integration profiles (in
        radiology, cardiology, laboratory, or in cross enterprise
        document sharing). Here again, the first decision that will be
        taken by the IHE committee that wishes to leverage PAM for its
        domain, will be to select the proper set of options and to
        ascertain the consistent use of these options in its domain.
      </para>
      <para>
        Thus, during the building process of IHE domain technical
        frameworks, as well as in the deployment process, the PAM
        Profile will be constrained to reduce its original number of
        options.
      </para>
      <para>
        However, to accommodate situations in which a consumer
        application would not support an option implemented by a
        supplier application, the PAM Profile requires that the consumer
        application shall application-reject a message that it does not
        support (see ITI TF-2x: C.2.3).

          In order to obtain patient identity and demographics

          in transaction [ITI-31], a Patient Encounter Supplier is
          required to be grouped with either a Patient Demographics

        <para>
          On the other hand, transaction [ITI-31] is self-contained in a
          sense that the Patient Encounter Supplier sends both patient
          encounter information and patient identity and demographics
          information (in the context of the encounter data) to the
          Patient Encounter Consumer. In addition, transaction [ITI-31]
          also allows the Patient Encounter Supplier to send messages to
          the Patient Encounter Consumer for patient identity
          maintenance in the encounter context, including patient update
          and identity merge. There is no required grouping for the
          Patient Encounter Consumer.

          The PAM Profile provides an infrastructure in a healthcare
          enterprise or across a number of enterprises to distribute the
          patient identity, demographics, and encounter information, in
          order to enable various clinical functions in clinical
          settings. The PAM actors can be grouped with actors in other
          IHE Integration Profiles.
        </para>
        <para>
          One possible grouping is between the Patient Demographics
          Supplier in the PDQ Profile and either the Patient
          Demographics Supplier or the Patient Demographics Consumer in
          this profile, to add query support defined in the Patient
          Demographics Query transaction to the same set of patient
          information managed in the PAM Profile.
        </para>
        <para>
          Furthermore, the Patient Demographics Supplier in the PDQ
          Profile can be grouped with the Patient Encounter Supplier of
          this profile. Due to the required grouping of the Patient
          Encounter Supplier (see Section 14.4.1), such a grouping can
          provide query support defined in both the Patient Demographics
          Query and Patient Demographics and Visit Query transactions to
          the same set of patient and encounter information that is
          managed in the PAM Profile.
        </para>
        <para>
          These are some examples of possible grouping of the PAM actors
          with other IHE actors. Many other possibilities may be useful
          (either to provide additional values or to allow profile
          structure simplification). For example, in the radiology
          scheduled workflow (SWF) Profile, the Order Placer and Order
          Filler Actors can be grouped with the Patient Encounter
          Consumer Actor.

    <para>
      Cross-Enterprise Document Reliable Interchange (XDR) provides
      document interchange using a reliable messaging system. This
      permits direct document interchange between EHRs, PHRs, and other
      healthcare IT systems in the absence of a document sharing
      infrastructure such as XDS Registry and Repositories.
    </para>
    <para>
      XDR provides a reliable and automatic transfer of documents and
      metadata for one patient between EHR systems even in the absence
      of an XDS infrastructure. XDR supports the reuse of the Provide
      and Register Set transaction-b with Web-Services as transport.
      Transfer is direct from source to consumer; no repository or
      registry actors are involved.
    </para>
    <para>
      XDR is document format agnostic, supporting the same document
      content as XDS and XDM. Document content is described in XDS
      Document Content Profiles. Examples are XDS-MS, XD-LAB, XPHR, and
      XDS-SD.
    </para>
    <para>
      XDR defines no new metadata or message formats. It leverages XDS

        The profile assumes that the health organizations that are using
        Document Source and Document Recipient have an agreement
        defining when they can interchange PHI. This may require an
        explicit patient consent (depending on the regulation) and an

        the security policies. The main aspects that should be covered
        by this agreement are similar to XDS – See Appendix L. In the

        transient XDS Affinity Domain. In addition, the following

      Cross-Enterprise Document Media Interchange (XDM) provides
      document interchange using a common file and directory structure
      over several standard media types. This permits the patient to use
      physical media to carry medical documents. This also permits the

      The common thread of these use cases is that they are
      person-to-person communications. The XDM solution is intended to
      be easy to implement with pre-existing email clients, CD burners
      and USB ports. XDM does not include any additional reliability
      enhancements. XDM requires that the recipient be able to support
      human intervention in order to manually control the importing of
      the data (patient ID reconciliation, selection of patient of
      interest from possibly multiple patients’ documents on the media).
    </para>
    <para>
      XDM is document format agnostic, supporting the same document
      content as XDS and XDR. Document content is described in Document
      Content Profiles. Examples are XDS-MS, XPHR, XDS-SD, and XD-LAB.

    <title>Retrieve Form for Data Capture (RFD) </title>
    <para>
      The Retrieve Form for Data Capture (RFD) Profile provides a method
      for gathering data within a user’s current application to meet the
      requirements of an external system. RFD supports the retrieval of
      a form from a form source, the display and completion of the form,
      and the return of instance data from the display application to a
      receiving application. In addition, RFD provides a mechanism to
      amend data that was previously captured.
    </para>
    <para>
      Consider the case where a healthcare provider site uses an
      Electronic Health Record (EHR) to document patient care. In this
      case, the EHR acts as the local home application for the
      provider’s personnel. Suppose an external agency, through some
      contractual arrangement, requires data from the provider, some of
      which reside in the EHR’s database, the rest requiring data entry
      by the EHR’s users. RFD enables the EHR user to retrieve a data
      capture form from the external agency, to fill out the form, and
      to return the data to the external agency without leaving the
      provider’s local home application, the EHR. The profile also
      permits the external agency to indicate that there is a need to
      clarify points about the data so captured and provides the
      mechanisms to allow the data to be modified.
    </para>
    <para>
      Many potential uses of RFD want the form to dynamically
      pre-populate forms from the host application’s database, that is
      have the form delivered with host application database values
      filled in to appropriate fields of a form. RFD permits automatic
      form population and provides a generic mechanism by which this can
      be accomplished. However, the profile does not speak to the issue
      of content, remaining silent on normative vocabularies and other
      enablers of semantic interoperability. Specific domain groups –
      clinical trials, drug safety, bio-surveillance – will build on RFD
      by contributing content specifications or by evaluating and
      recommending existing content standards that will operate within
      RFD. When RFD, as an infrastructure profile, integrates with
      domain-specific content standards, a much greater level of
      interoperability will result.
    </para>
    <para>
      The RFD Profile provides a generic polling mechanism to allow an
      external agency to indicate issues with data that have been
      captured and enable the healthcare provider to correct the data.
      The profile does not dictate the mechanism employed or content
      required to achieve such corrections.
    </para>
    <para>
      In this profile, the external agency provides data capture forms
      in a schema appropriate to its domain. The profile intends to
      minimize the work that the displaying application should do, and
      to bring over fully functional forms that carry with them the
      instruction necessary to complete the form. RFD also supports
      archiving a copy of the completed form.
    </para>
    <para>
      RFD offers the capability to leverage industry standards that
      address both the structure and content of forms used for data
      capture. HL7’s Individual Case Safety Record (ICSR) and CDISC’s
      Operational Data Model (ODM) provide examples.

          The setting for the clinical trial use case is a physicians’
          practice where patient care is delivered side-by-side with
          clinical research. The site, Holbin Medical Group, is a
          multi-site physician practice, employing over 100 physicians
          in a variety of specialties. Holbin’s CEO encourages the
          physicians to participate as site investigators for
          pharmaceutical-sponsored clinical trials; Holbin provides
          support for clinical research activities in the form of a
          Research Department of twelve dedicated study coordinators,
          mostly RNs, along with clerical and data-entry support
          personnel. Holbin Medical Group uses an Electronic Health
          Record (EHR) and a number of sponsor-provided Electronic Data
          Capture (EDC) systems for documenting clinical trial
          activities. (For our purposes, an EHR is any application which
          is the primary site for documenting patient care and
          retrieving patient care information. Thus we include in our
          span of interest many systems installed today that are not
          quite EHRs in the strictest sense, but which would still
          benefit from this approach.)
        </para>
        <para>
          Holbin’s involvement in a clinical study begins when the
          Research Department receives a request for proposal from a
          study sponsor. A Study Coordinator, Patricia Zone, RN,
          evaluates the RFP for business viability and clinical
          appropriateness, and provides the requested documentation back
          to the sponsor. After being selected as a site for the trial,
          identified as #1234, and providing the required regulatory
          documentation to the sponsor, the physician identified as the
          Principal Investigator and other study personnel receive
          protocol-specific training from the sponsor. During the trial
          set-up period, Patricia ensures that the appropriate system
          security is in place for this protocol, recruits patients to
          participate as subjects according to inclusion and exclusion
          criteria described in the study protocol, schedules patient

          Patricia contacts Corey Jones, a patient at Holbin, about

          trial #1234, using the EHR’s patient index. She schedules
          Corey’s study visits using the EHR scheduling module, and
          flags the visits as pertaining to the trial #1234. After the

            visit and meets with Patricia Zone for a face-to-face
            interview. Patricia logs into the EHR and documents the
            visit with a terse entry: ‘Mrs. Jones comes in for a
            clinical trial visit associated with study #1234.’ Patricia
            interviews Mrs. Jones, makes some observations, and records
            her observation on a source paper document. She looks up
            recent lab results in the EHR and records them in the Case
            Report Form (CRF). The EHR provides only a portion of the
            data required to complete the form, the rest comes from the
            interview and observations. (Estimates on the percentage of
            data required for a clinical trial that would be available
            in an EHR vary from 5% to 40%. Even in the best case, the
            EHR typically captures only a subset of the data required by
            a study protocol.)

            The completed source document is forwarded to Bob, the data
            entry person. Bob identifies the CRF as belonging to trial
            #1234, and selects the trial #1234 EDC system, which may be
            housed on a dedicated laptop provided by the sponsor or may
            be accessible via a browser session connected to the
            Sponsor’s EDC system via the Internet. He takes a three ring
            binder off the shelf and refers to his ‘crib sheet’ to get
            the instructions for how to use this particular system. He
            logs into the EDC application, using a user name and
            password unique to this system, and enters the data into the
            correct electronic case report form (eCRF) for that trial
            visit. Once the source document has been processed, Bob
            files it in a ‘banker’s box’<footnote>

            In addition to trial #1234, Bob performs data entry on eight
            additional EDC systems, five on dedicated laptops and three
            that are web-based. The web-based EDC systems save on table
            space, but still require entries in the three ring binders
            where Bob puts his ‘crib sheets’. It is a chore to make sure
            that data from a particular trial gets entered into the
            corresponding laptop with its unique login ritual and data
            capture form, so Bob experiences much frustration in dealing
            with this unwieldy set of systems. Bob is a conscientious
            employee, and stays current in his work. But in many other
            sites the data entry person holds the CRF for a period of
            time before entering the data, perhaps entering data twice a
            month, or entering the data the week before the monitor
            visit occurs.

            Mrs. Jones arrives for a visit and Patricia logs into the
            EHR, pulls up Mrs. Jones’s record, and identifies the
            scheduled clinical trial visit. Because of the patient
            identification and scheduling steps that took place in the
            set-up stage, the EHR recognizes Mrs. Jones as a subject in
            Trial 1234, and requests an electronic case report form from
            trial #1234’s EDC system, using RFD. If the trial is
            sufficiently complex, the retrieved form may contain a list
            of relevant forms from the EDC system for Patricia to choose
            from. When the correct context is established between the
            EHR and the EDC, Patricia selects the clinical research tab
            within the EHR application to reveal the appropriate form.
            The EHR checks Patricia’s credentials, confirms that she is
            empowered to view the form, and displays the form. The data
            capture form is essentially the same form that the EDC
            system would offer for this visit, and its presentation may
            take on some of the look and feel of the EHR’s user
            interface. The use of a crib sheet may still be necessary,
            although sophisticated forms should carry with them
            information on how to fill out the form.

            archived in the site clinical trial document vault as part
            of the permanent source record of the trial.

              Anthrax: Patient presents at ED with rapidly progressive
              respiratory symptoms. Gram stain of sputum reveals gram
              positive rods, chest X-ray reveals a widened mediastinum,
              and patient's condition rapidly deteriorates. Culture of
              sputum in laboratory is suspicious for Bacillus anthracis.
              State DOH contacted and specimens sent for confirmation.
              Once confirmed, the state DOH notifies appropriate local,
              regional, state, and federal officials (e.g., CDC, FBI,
              USAMRID), and notifies local hospitals, providers, and
              media. (This involves a bioterrorist scenario on the back
              end after ID confirmation – the influenza scenario below
              does not, but probably invokes the same pathways.)

            <para>
              Once notified of the potential for additional cases, the
              ED performs STAT Gram stains on sputa and PA/Lateral Chest
              X-rays for all patients presenting with rapidly
              progressive respiratory symptoms. Presence of Gram
              positive rods in sputum is entered directly into the lab
              system OR by designated ER staff into a specific ADT field
              on the patient ADT screen in the CIS for internal /
              external surveillance reporting. Rapid reading of Chest
              X-ray with mediastinal widening is entered in a specific
              ADT field by designated staff (e.g., Radiology technician)
              on behalf of physician. Entry of information in these
              fields creates a transaction of the information to the
              local public health department biosurveillance system
              (BIS) as presumptively diagnosed inhalational anthrax. The
              BIS aggregates information received from multiple sites to
              present the location, origin and extent of presumptive and
              defined case presentation.

              Influenza: Physicians around hospital and hospital ED get
              rapidly increasing number of patients with respiratory
              symptoms suggestive of a viral infection, but no increased
              prevalence of similar symptoms in surrounding hospitals.
              Rapid test for influenza A/B is positive in many of the
              patients and epidemic influenza is circulating in the
              community. Respiratory culture is negative for bacterial
              pathogen at 24 hr., but viral culture is positive for
              influenza A. AH5N1 is suspected due to association of
              patients with each other and “dead chickens”. All
              specimens are sent to state DOH ASAP for ID. State lab
              identifies AH5N1. Follow-up similar to #1 above. The
              follow-up once notification is disseminated from health
              department(s) to local providers, is similar to the
              presumptive diagnosis information transmission to public
              health BIS. A more robust method for collection of
              presumptive diagnoses in either scenario (but not
              near-term) is to use standardized “problem” terms (using
              SNOMED) for selection of presumptive problems as part of
              routine operations of a CIS for physician order entry and
              for physician and nursing documentation.

            outcome, event date, report date, description, relevant
            tests (he notes that a test has been ordered), and other

          <para>
            Several jurisdictions have mandatory requirements for
            submission of data for particular cardiac procedures, (e.g.,
            New York State for angioplasty and cardiac surgery, or the
            US for implantation of cardioverter defibrillators in
            Medicare patients). Additionally, many institutions
            participate in voluntary regional or national data
            registries, notably the NCDR™ National Cardiovascular Data
            Registry.
          </para>
          <para>
            A single cardiac patient’s data may be submitted to multiple
            registries. It is therefore useful for data collections for
            multiple submissions to be done simultaneously, so that the
            nurse preparing the data can review the patient medical
            record once and extract relevant data to each of the
            submission forms. Additionally, the patient’s “medical
            record” is in fact spread across several electronic and
            paper-based systems, so that repeated access in the
            preparation of multiple submissions must be minimized.
          </para>
          <para>
            Most of the cardiac registry submissions require data from
            several encounters. E.g., the NCDR gathers data on patients
            who undergo diagnostic cardiac catheterization followed by a
            percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). If the patient had
            presented to the Emergency Department with an ST-elevation
            infarction, only a small portion of the NCDR-required data
            is gathered in association with the catheterization
            procedure. The following information is needed to complete
            the NCDR data set: Date of previous CABG, date of previous
            PCI, time of arrival in the ER, baseline laboratory data
            (BUN, creatinine), information from the patient’s history
            (family history of CAD, history of stroke, pulmonary and
            renal disease, etc.), measured cardiac ejection fraction
            prior to PCI, QCA findings, inventory of the devices used
            (including bar codes), and medications administered.
          </para>
          <para>
            Thus, the preparation of the submission must be done
            incrementally at each encounter, and/or retrospectively at a
            time that all the information can be determined. Incremental
            preparation is problematic, since at the initial encounters
            it is not known what procedures the patient will undergo,
            and hence what registries’ data forms need to be filled in.
            Purely retrospective data collection is similarly
            problematic, as it is better to obtain the data when it is
            produced, rather than needing to search through the record
            for it.

            national registry for the quarter from the repository, and
            to prepare the submission. She does a similar task with an
            application that processes the state registry forms.

          <para>
            A major issue in cardiology is improving the quality of care
            by monitoring select performance measures. There is a strong
            collaborative arrangement between the ACC, AHA, CMS, JCAHO,
            and AHRQ on the development and use of performance measures,
            such as the new ACC/AHA Clinical Performance Measures for
            Adults with ST-Elevation and Non–ST-Elevation Myocardial
            Infarction.
          </para>
          <para>
            These performance measures require data collection, similar
            to the collection of data for submission to registries.
            However, after collection of data for a particular time
            period, further analysis on the total patient population
            must be applied to obtain an appropriate denominator for the
            reported measures (i.e., certain patients must be
            retrospectively excluded from the population data set).

        Registry</title>
        <para>
          As part of the effort to assess the impact of PET imaging on
          cancer patient management, the Centers for Medicare and
          Medicaid Services have predicated reimbursement, for a number
          of otherwise non-reimbursed procedures, on the submission of
          study data to a National Oncologic PET Registry (NOPR)
          operated by the American College of Radiology at
          www.cancerpetregistry.org.
        </para>
        <para>
          This use case involves a sequence of forms which must be
          submitted for a given patient study and includes overlaps with
          the billing process.
        </para>
        <para>
          PET Facilities are required to register their site with NOPR.
          Because access to NOPR is limited to registered facilities and
          because the facility depends on complete submission to get the
          reimbursement, the PET Facility has the primary responsibility
          and direct access for submitting all data. The referring
          physician does not have access to NOPR.
        </para>
        <para>
          Paul Positron, a patient, presents with indications of stomach
          cancer (or other indication covered only by participation in
          the NOPR). His physician, Dr. Jones, refers him to PET-Pros, a
          participating PET facility. PET-Pros obtains basic demographic
          information from Dr. Jones and submits this information to
          NOPR via a Web form, at which time a Registry case number is
          assigned by NOPR.
        </para>
        <para>
          Once a Registry case number is created, NOPR emails Dr. Jones
          the Pre-PET Form that must be completed with case specific
          clinical details and forwarded to PET-Pros for entry into the
          NOPR database by midnight of the day of the PET scan.
        </para>
        <para>
          At some time before the PET study, or when Paul arrives for
          the PET scan, PET-Pros provides Paul with the ACR IRB-approved
          standard NOPR Patient Information Sheet. Paul can contact the
          NOPR directly for more information, if necessary. Paul
          indicates his NOPR consent verbally to staff at the PET
          facility, either on the day of the PET study or within two
          working days after the PET study is completed. Written consent
          is not required. PET-Pros notes in the PET Report Form, if the
          patient gave or withheld consent for use of his data in future
          NOPR research.
        </para>
        <para>
          Once the PET scan has been performed and reported, PET-Pros
          submits a study completion form and a report form (including
          the report provided to Dr. Jones) to NOPR.
        </para>
        <para>
          NOPR emails Dr. Jones the Post-PET Form for completion. This
          form collects information relating to the impact of the scan.
          It also includes an ACR IRB-approved Referring Physician
          Information Sheet and indication whether physician consent for
          use of the response data in future NOPR research has been
          given or withheld. The Post-PET form must be completed,
          forwarded to PET-Pros and entered into the NOPR database
          within 30 days of the PET scan.
        </para>
        <para>
          The NOPR database notifies PET-Pros when all case data have
          been entered so that the facility can bill CMS for the study.
          PET-Pros can check on the case status of their patients at any
          time using the PET Facility Reporting Tools available on the
          NOPR Web site.

          There is a need for a clarification process that enables a
          sponsor organization to highlight data that needs to be
          examined and potentially corrected. These are detected by
          sponsor-initiated checks (edit checks) that result in sponsor
          data queries for clarification, correction, or verification
          relating to previously submitted data. These queries about
          previously submitted data are provided to the EHR system upon
          request. Note that there is no automated notification to the
          EHR that these queries for clarification / correction /
          verification exist. It is up to the EHR to periodically make
          requests when working with a sponsor that performs these edit
          checks. Performing these longitudinal edit checks on submitted
          data does not apply to all use cases.

          <para>
            Edit checks built in to eCRFs can facilitate accurate and
            complete data capture; however, it is probable that during
            the course of a trial, some data elements will need to be
            reviewed by the site for clarification, correction, or
            verification. As data managers review the data (through
            manual and/or system-supported validation processes), they
            identify missing, incomplete, or potentially discrepant data
            (e.g., a site reports a patient was prescribed penicillin
            for a headache). Data queries are generated through an EDC
            system and sent back to the site for clarification/
            correction/ verification by the research coordinator. For
            each data query, the coordinator must reference the source
            record where the data element was originally documented and
            compare the queried data element to the source. On
            occasions, the site may need to contact the patient if the
            source is incomplete (e.g., a stop date on a medication).
            Clarifications to the data are documented by the coordinator
            in the source and if it is determined that the source record
            is in error, corrections are clearly documented in the
            source per GCP guidelines. The coordinator then responds to
            the query in the EDC system providing a reason for any
            updates to the original record which the system captures in
            the audit trail. The data manager can then review the
            updates and the response and close the query if no further
            information is required.

            system and prepared to the site for clarification/
            correction/ verification by the research coordinator. The
            EHR study coordinator accesses and reviews each data query
            through the EHR system referencing the EHR data in order to

            clarifications to the data in the EHR system if needed and
            submits a query response as well as any data updates to the

            The Retrieve Form transaction carries the form identifier
            from a Form Filler to a Form Manager, or Form Processor. The
            transaction allows a Form Filler to optionally specify a
            Form Archiver Actor. Additional data containing context
            information as well as workflow information may be supplied
            with the request to facilitate the selection and
            pre-population of the requested form. The value of the
            assigned form identifier determines the format of the form.
            Assignment of form identifiers is not profiled and is
            assumed to take place as a part of the setup configuration

        The identifier of a form, the formID, is known to the Form
        Filler, such as may happen during the registration process for
        participation in a Clinical Trial. formID values could also be
        communicated by publication of form directories or by personal

      <para>
        The Form Filler makes a Retrieve Form request to a Form Manager
        or a Form Processor. The Form Manager or Form Processor either
        returns the requested form, or an error indicating no form is
        available. When a form is returned, the Form Filler will
        subsequently submit the form instance data to a Form Receiver or
        back to the Form Processor using the Submit Form transaction.
        When a Form Manager and Form Receiver are grouped, there may be
        communications between the Form Receiver and the Form Manager,
        as would be necessary to support partially completed forms, but
        these communications are internal and are not IHE transactions.

        The identifier of a form, the formID, is known to the Form

        Receiver on a different system for final storage of form data.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Form Filler makes a Retrieve Form request to a Form Manager.
        The Form Manager either returns the requested form or an error
        indicating no form is available. When a form is returned, the
        Form Filler submits partially complete forms to the intermediate
        Form Receiver. This partially completed form can be retrieved
        with another Retrieve Form request to the Form Manager, and
        final completed form data can be submitted to the final storage,
        standalone, Form Receiver, such as a national data registry. The
        action upon submit is controlled by the form, hence the Form
        Manager is responsible for defining the post-submit action by
        selection of, or generation of, the desired action during the
        Retrieve Form transaction processing.

        constructs the form to perform an archive transaction to the
        Form Archiver specified in the Form Filler’s Retrieve Form
        request. When the form is returned and subsequently submitted,
        form instance data is submitted to the Form Receiver and also to
        the Form Archiver.

        <emphasis role="strong">Case 4</emphasis>: This case illustrates
        one way to use Form design to solve the issue where a formID is
        not known in advance. The identifier of a form, the formID, is
        not known to the Form Filler, but a set of context value (name,
        value) pairs is known. A context form where these values could
        be entered would have a formID. Information collected by the
        instance of a context form would be used by the Form Manager to
        determine the appropriate data capture form to return to the
        Form Filler.

        The Form Filler has enough information to request a context form
        that collects information that can help the Form Manager
        determine the actual data capture form. The Form Filler
        completes the context form, submits this to the Form Receiver

        Filler supports the Data Clarifications Option.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Form Filler makes a Retrieve Clarifications request to a
        Form Manager. The interactions of Form Receiver and Form Manager
        are outside of the scope of this profile. An example of a
        solution for providing clarification information to a Form
        Manager is to group the Form Manager with the Form Receiver, as
        shown in Figures 17.4-5 and 17.4-6. The request made by the Form
        Filler contains an organization identifier allowing the Form
        Manager to return only the set of clarifications relevant to the
        organization making the request. The Form Manager returns a form
        containing the necessary information to allow the site or
        organization making the request to amend the data as required.
        These Retrieve Clarifications requests must be periodically
        executed by the Form Filler. The frequency of request is likely
        based upon some duration as defined or agreed upon by the Form
        Manager / Form Receiver.
      </para>
      <para>
        The Form Manager can return either a form containing the data to
        be modified or a form containing a list of references to other
        forms. In the second case, the references are used to obtain the
        individual forms using the Retrieve Form transaction. In both
        cases the data are then modified and submitted to the Form
        Receiver using the Submit Form transaction. Submitted data may
        then be evaluated by the data manager of the sponsor for proper
        handling.
      </para>
      <para>
        The profile does not distinguish between the two responses, the
        content returned within the form allows the user of the Form

    <para>
      The Cross-Community Access Profile supports the means to query and
      retrieve patient relevant medical data held by other communities.
      A community is defined as a coupling of facilities/enterprises
      that have agreed to work together using a common set of policies
      for the purpose of sharing clinical information via an established
      mechanism. Facilities/enterprises may host any type of healthcare
      application such as EHR, PHR, etc. A community is identifiable by
      a globally unique id called the homeCommunityId. Membership of a
      facility/enterprise in one community does not preclude it from
      being a member in another community. Such communities may be XDS
      Affinity Domains which define document sharing using the XDS
      Profile or any other communities, no matter what their internal
      sharing structure.

        <para>
          Grouping with a Document Consumer is used in situations where
          an Initiating Gateway and/or Responding Gateway are supporting
          an XDS Affinity Domain
        </para>
        <para>
          When an Initiating Gateway is supporting an XDS Affinity
          Domain, it can choose to query and retrieve from local actors
          in addition to remote communities. This is accomplished by
          grouping the Initiating Gateway with a Document Consumer
          Actor. This grouping allows Document Consumers such as
          EHR/PHR/etc. systems to query the Initiating Gateway to
          retrieve document information and content from both the local
          XDS Affinity Domain as well as remote communities. For details
          see Section 18.2.3.1. An Initiating Gateway that is not
          grouped with a Document Consumer is only able to return
          results from remote communities, so local EHR/PHR/etc. systems
          (Document Consumer Actors) must direct separate query and
          document retrieve transactions internally and externally.
        </para>
        <para>
          When a Responding Gateway is supporting an XDS Affinity
          Domain, it may resolve Cross Gateway Query and Cross Gateway
          Retrieve Transactions by grouping with a Document Consumer and
          using the Registry Stored Query and Retrieve Document Set
          transactions. For details see Section 18.2.3.2

          <para>
            Figure 18.3.3-2 shows the use of an On-Demand Document Entry
            to allow access to the most recently available set of data
            from a responding community. This example does not show the
            Gateways interacting with XDS Actors and does not assume
            that XDS is used in any of the communities. This workflow
            includes persisting each document returned as a result of a
            retrieve and forming a stable document entry describing the
            new document which will be returned to future Cross Gateway
            Query requests. The semantics of the response to a retrieve
            of an On-Demand Document Entry are different than the
            semantics of the response to retrieval of stable documents.
            The response to a retrieve of an On-Demand Document Entry
            contains a new uniqueId, different than the uniqueId
            specified in the request, which is the same as the value
            within the ClinicalDocument id of the document returned. Use
            of an appropriate query against that new uniqueId will allow
            the requestor access to updated metadata about the document,
            including size, hash, etc. This workflow assumes that some
            change to the underlying data occurs between the time
            Community A retrieves on-demand document entry #5, and
            Community C retrieves on-demand document entry #5. That is
            why #6 is not re-used in response to Community C’s request.

      The document sharing infrastructure provided by XD* allow for the
      publication and use of clinical documents associated with a
      patient. This profile allows for a Patient Privacy Policy Domain
      (e.g., an XDS Affinity Domain to have a number of Patient Privacy
      Policies that can be acknowledged (aka consent). This allows for
      more flexibility to support some patient concerns, while providing
      an important and useful dataset to the healthcare provider.
      Without BPPC, the XDS Profile requires that the administrators of
      an XDS Affinity Domain creates and agrees to a single document
      publication and use policy (see ITI TF-1: Appendix L). Such a
      single XDS Affinity Domain Policy is enforced in a distributed way
      through the inherent access controls of the systems involved in
      the XDS Affinity Domain.

      This profile will use terms consistent with ISO 22600 - Privilege

      to refer to the human-subject of health related data. In this
      context “Patient” is not to imply only those subjects under
      current treatment, this is sometimes referred to as “consumer”.
      This profile uses the term “Consent” to mean acknowledgement of a
      privacy policy, also known as an information access policy. In
      this context the privacy policy may include constraints and
      obligations. The systems involved in XDS are expected to support

      Healthcare providers utilize many different sets of data to carry
      out treatment, billing, and normal operations. This information
      may include patient demographics, contacts, insurance information,
      dietary requirements, general clinical information and sensitive
      clinical information. This information may be published (e.g., to
      XDS, XDR, XDM, PACS) as independent documents with different
      sensitivity labels (i.e., confidentialityCode). This mechanism is
      not unique to BPPC, but is leveraged by privacy and security
      policies.
    </para>
    <para>
      Healthcare providers in different functional roles will have
      different needs to access these documents. For example,
      administrators may need to be able to access the patient
      demographics, billing and contact documents. Dietary staff will
      need access to the dietary documents but would not need access to
      insurance documents. General care providers will want access to
      most clinical documents, and direct care providers should have
      access to all clinical documents. This is an example of a Patient
      Privacy Policy that would be given a Patient Privacy Policy
      Identifier within a Patient Privacy Policy Domain. When a patient
      acknowledges this policy, the Patient Privacy Policy document
      would refer to the policy by the Patient Privacy Policy
      Identifier.

      This profile provides a mechanism by which an XDS Affinity Domain
      can create a basic vocabulary of codes that identify Patient
      Privacy Domain managed Privacy Policy Identifiers with respect to
      document sharing. Each Privacy Policy Identifier uniquely
      identifies a Privacy Policy which should identify in legal text
      what the acceptable use, re-disclosure uses, which functional
      roles may access which document and under which conditions, etc.
      The administration of the XDS Affinity Domain will assign each
      Privacy Policy Identifiers for use within the XDS Affinity Domain.
      Future profiles may include in addition to the legal text, a
      structured and coded expression of the consent policy that can be
      used to support even more dynamic understanding of the patient's
      directives (see HL7 and OASIS).

        This section gives examples of some possible patient privacy
        consent policies and how the systems publishing documents and
        using documents might act. This is an informative section and
        should not be interpreted as the only way to implement the BPPC
        Profile. Its purpose is to allow implementers of BPPC to more
        easily understand the principle of operation of BPPC.

        Consent</emphasis></title>
        <para>
          This profile supports both Implied Consent as well as Explicit
          Consent environments. In order to provide a profile with
          global appeal we have supported both environments. In an
          implied consent environment, it would be normal for a Document
          Consumer to find no instance of a patient specific
          acknowledgement of a privacy consent policy in the XDS
          Affinity Domain, as capturing the act of acknowledging a
          privacy consent policy would not be required. Note: this may
          also be true in an Explicit Consent environment, where
          obtaining the acknowledgement is delayed due to medical
          reasons (e.g., emergency).
        </para>
        <para>
          An XDS Affinity Domain might have a paper document that
          describes their Privacy Consent Policy. In our example this
          Privacy Consent Policy will be given a local XDS Affinity
          Domain managed Privacy Policy Identifier (e.g., an OID such
          as: 9.8.7.6.5.4.3.2.1). The example in Figure 19.1-1 is
          ridiculous (i.e., chicken costume) but is provided to
          emphasize that IHE doesn’t write these policies, and to make
          clear that the BPPC Profile could be used to enforce any
          policy that could be written in human readable form, provided
          that all actors can be configured to enforce that policy. This
          example also points out that the content of the policy is
          human readable text, and that we provide no structured or
          coded way to interpret. This example policy might look like
          Figure 19.1.1-1.

          <title>Opt-In</title>
          <para>
            A common structure for sharing clinical documents requires
            that the patient first acknowledge that they want this
            sharing to happen before any documents are actually shared.
            In this case the XDS Affinity Domain administrators would
            write a policy that indicates what should be shared, when it
            should be shared, when it can be used, etc. There would also
            be an overriding XDS Affinity Domain policy that indicates
            that no document will be shared until the patient has
            explicitly chosen to participate.
          </para>
        </section>
        <section xml:id="opt-out">
          <title> Opt-Out</title>
          <para>
            Equally as common is a structure for sharing documents that
            presumes that when the patient chooses to get care within a
            care setting, that they are implicitly agreeing to the
            normal sharing of their documents for treatment purposes. In
            this environment, there is usually a control that allows a
            patient to choose to NOT participate in this sharing. This
            is commonly referred to as “opt-out”.
          </para>
          <para>
            In this case the existence an acknowledgement to an opt-out
            policy would mean that documents should no longer be shared,
            and any documents that might appear should not be used.
            Clearly the XDS Affinity Domain administrators need to make
            the actual behavior clear in their policies.

        <para>
          An XDS Affinity Domain may have jurisdictional or
          organizational policies that require support for more complex
          patient privacy consent policies. These privacy policies may
          require that a patient explicitly consent to disclosure of
          protected or sensitive health information to specific
          entities. The BPPC Profile provides a starting point for
          implementing these types of privacy consent policies, but does
          not explicitly specify how additional information needed to
          enforce the policy would be conveyed. In these cases, the
          capability of BPPC may not be enough to support all types of
          needs. An example of an Advanced Patient Privacy Consent would
          be when a patient wants to name individuals that can access
          their documents.

      <title> Creating Patient Privacy Policies</title>
      <para>
        The administrators of the Patient Privacy Policy Domain (e.g.,
        XDS Affinity Domain) will need to develop and publish an overall
        Policy for the Patient Privacy Policy Domain that clearly
        defines the overall appropriate use of the protected resources.
        This is the subject of ITI TF-1: Appendix L and is not further
        defined here.
      </para>
      <para>
        Within this Patient Privacy Policy Domain (e.g., XDS Affinity
        Domain) overall Policy is a defined set of acceptable use
        Patient Privacy Policies. A Patient Privacy Policy further
        explains appropriate use of the protected resources in a way
        that provides choices to the patient. The BPPC Profile places no
        requirements on the content of these policies nor the method
        used to develop these policies (see ITI TF-1: Appendix P for
        some guidance on developing these policies). BPPC only assumes
        that the overall Patient Privacy Policy Domain can be structured
        as a set of specific policies (A, B, C, D in the example below),
        where each one may be used independently or combined in
        relationship to publication and access of a specific type(s) of
        document.

      </para>
      <para>
        A Patient Privacy Policy will identify who has access to
        information, and what information is governed by the policy
        (e.g., under what conditions will a document marked as
        containing sensitive information be used by a specific type of
        individual for a specific use). The mechanism for publishing
        these policies is not described by this profile. The set of
        Patient Privacy Policies written by the Patient Privacy Policy
        Domain must be able to be implemented by the technologies in all
        of the systems that have access to the domain. This means that
        the Patient Privacy Policies must be created with great care to
        ensure they are enforceable.
      </para>
      <para>
        Each Patient Privacy Policy will be given a unique identifier
        (OID) known as a Patient Privacy Policy Identifier. This is
        additionally used when capturing a patient’s acknowledgement of
        a specific Patient Privacy Policy resulting in a Patient Privacy
        Policy Acknowledgement Document (i.e., an instance of a BPPC
        document).
      </para>
      <para>
        Finally, Privacy Consent Policies used within an XDS Affinity
        Domain will very likely be different than those used with the
        XDM or XDR Profiles as these profiles often are used to transfer
        documents in ad-hoc ways. The patient may provide a consent
        given to share information on media to the provider creating the
        media for specific use, rather than for more general sharing
        within an XDS Affinity Domain. When transferring information
        that originated in an XDS Affinity Domain to media (XDM), the
        Privacy Consent Policies found in the XDS Affinity Domain might
        be changed during the publication process. There are also
        differences in the sensitivity that should be considered for
        consents shared on media or transmitted through XDR and those
        shared in an XDS Affinity Domain. See the section Security
        Considerations later in this volume for more details.

          An XDS Document Consumer that is enforcing policies registered
          by BPPC can query an XDS Affinity Domain for instances of
          Patient Privacy Policy Acknowledgement Documents that have

          Note if the local regulations allow, some XDS Affinity Domains

      <title>Security Considerations</title>
      <para>
        Consents stored in an XDS Affinity Domain are also governed by
        privacy policies. The content of a Patient Privacy Policy
        Acknowledgement Document may itself contain sensitive
        information. For example, a terminally ill patient may decide
        that his prognosis should not be shared with his family members,
        but that other information may be. Sharing the Patient Privacy
        Policy Acknowledgement Document with family members would
        potentially inform them of a negative prognosis. Thus, the
        confidentialityCode placed on Patient Privacy Policy
        Acknowledgement Documents must be appropriately assigned (e.g.,
        most will be assigned the broadest use confidentialityCode).
      </para>
      <para>
        However, Patient Privacy Policy Acknowledgement Documents stored
        in the clear on media (XDM), or transmitted through XDR, should
        not contain sensitive information. The rationale is that the
        receiver of the information must be able to read the consent
        that was used to share this information in order to understand
        how they must treat the information with respect to their own
        Patient Privacy Policies.
      </para>
      <para>
        Implementation of Patient Privacy Policies within a healthcare
        environment has different considerations and risks than
        implementing similar access control policies within other
        non-treatment environments. This is for the simple reason that
        failing to provide access to critical healthcare information has
        the risk of causing serious injury or death to a patient. This
        risk must be balanced against the risk of prosecution or lawsuit
        due to accidental or malicious disclosure of private
        information. The XDS Affinity Domain should take care in writing
        their Patient Privacy Policies to avoid this.
      </para>
      <para>
        One mitigation strategy that is often adopted in healthcare
        provides accountability through audit controls. That is to say
        that the healthcare providers are trusted not to abuse their
        access to private information, but that this is followed up by a
        policy of monitoring healthcare provider accesses to private
        information to ensure that abuse does not occur. This strategy
        reduces the risk of serious death or injury due to lack of
        access to critical healthcare information, at the increased risk
        of disclosure of private information. This is why the ITI
        Technical Committee created the Audit Trail and Node
        Authentication (ATNA) Integration Profile, and furthermore, why
        that profile is a requirement of XDS and related profiles.
      </para>
      <para>
        Another risk that must be resolved by an affinity domain is how
        to address the issues of sharing truly sensitive information in
        a registry (e.g., psychology documents). One strategy that might
        be recommended is that truly sensitive data not be shared within
        the XDS Affinity Domain; directed communications using XDR or
        XDM may be more appropriate.

      A variety of legacy paper, film, electronic and scanner outputted
      formats are used to store and exchange clinical documents. These
      formats are not designed for healthcare documentation, and
      furthermore, do not have a uniform mechanism to store healthcare
      metadata associated with the documents, including patient
      identifiers, demographics, encounter, order or service
      information. The association of structured, healthcare metadata
      with this kind of document is important to maintain the integrity
      of the patient health record as managed by the source system. It
      is necessary to provide a mechanism that allows such source
      metadata to be stored with the document.

      This profile defines how to couple such information, represented

          Legacy Clinic is a small two-physician clinic. They presently
          store their patient's medical records on paper. The Clinic is
          trying to figure out what to do with its paper and word
          processing documents as it converts over to an electronic
          system. They would like to be able to view the files over
          their local intranet.
        </para>
        <para>
          Presently, most records are handwritten on preprinted paper
          forms that are inserted into specific sections of the
          patient's chart. More detailed encounter reports are dictated
          and sent to a transcription company that returns them in a
          word processing format. The medical records clerk at Legacy
          Clinic receives these files via e-mail, decrypts them, prints
          them out, and adds them to the patient's chart in the correct
          section.
        </para>
        <para>
          Over the years, Legacy Clinic has used a number of different
          transcription companies, and the documents are stored in a
          variety of word processing formats. Several years ago, they
          began to require that returned documents be in RTF format in
          an attempt to reduce frustrations induced by dealing with
          discrepant word processing formats. Only in some cases was
          patient and encounter metadata stored within the word
          processing document in a regular format, depending upon the
          transcription company used at the time. A third party
          presently handles labs for the clinic. These are usually
          returned to the Clinic as printed documents. The clerk inserts
          these into the labs section in the patient's chart.
        </para>
        <para>
          In the case of Legacy Clinic, the link between the word
          processing documents and the patient has been maintained for
          many of its documents, since the existing manual process
          maintains that association, and some of the files also contain
          the encounter metadata. However, the link to the specific
          encounter will need to be reestablished by interpreting the
          document content, which will require a great deal of manual
          effort for some of their documents which do not have it, and
          will still require custom handling depending upon the format
          used to store this metadata.

          Content is consumed by a Content Consumer. Impact on
          application function and workflow is implementation specific
          and out of scope of this content profile. However, we note
          that adoption of this profile will necessitate the Content
          Consumer, upon document receipt, support the processing of
          both CDA wrapped PDF and CDA wrapped plaintext.

        There are two actors in the XDS-SD Profile, the Content Creator
        and the Content Consumer. Content is created by a Content
        Creator and is to be consumed by a Content Consumer. The sharing
        or transmission of content from one actor to the other is
        addressed by the appropriate use of IHE profiles described
        below, and is out of scope of this profile. A Document Source or
        a Portable Media Creator may embody the Content Creator Actor. A
        Document Consumer, a Document Recipient or a Portable Media
        Importer may embody the Content Consumer Actor. The sharing or
        transmission of content or updates from one actor to the other
        is addressed by the use of appropriate IHE profiles described in
        the section on Content Bindings with XDS, XDM and XDR.

        Actors from the ITI XDS, XDM and XDR Profiles embody the Content
        Creator and Content Consumer sharing function of this profile. A
        Content Creator or Content Consumer may be grouped with
        appropriate actors from the XDS, XDM or XDR Profiles to exchange
        the content described therein. The metadata sent in the document
        sharing or interchange messages has specific relationships or
        dependencies (which we call bindings) to the content of the
        clinical document described in the content profile. The Patient
        Care Coordination Technical Framework (PCC TF) defines the
        bindings to use when grouping the Content Creator of this
        profile with actors from the IHE ITI XDS, XDM or XDR Integration

      <emphasis>The Sharing Value Sets (SVS) Profile provides a means

      laboratory reporting systems, primary care physician office EMR

    <para>
      A single Value Set Repository can be accessed by many Value Set
      Consumers, establishing a domain of consistent and uniform set of
      nomenclatures. It supports automated loading of Value Sets by
      Value Set Consumers, reducing the burden of manual configuration.
      This profile describes two transactions for retrieving Value Sets
      from a Value Set Repository by a Value Set Consumer.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          A single value set can be retrieved based on an OID value.
          This is aimed at meeting the needs of systems that are
          pre-configured to use specific value sets. These systems are
          often medical devices with strictly controlled functions that
          should not be modified without careful review. This
          transaction does not include metadata content, and provides
          just the value set concept list as uniquely identified in the
          request.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Multiple value sets can be retrieved based on metadata about
          the value sets. This is aimed at meeting the needs of systems
          and users that will be dynamically selecting value sets,
          deciding which value sets should be used, and creating new
          value sets based on the contents of existing value sets. This
          transaction supports much richer selection criteria and
          provides metadata descriptions as well as the contents
          (expanded lists of coded values) of all the value sets that
          meet those criteria.

    <para>
      Both transactions provide access to centrally managed value sets
      that have been assigned metadata, including group identification.
      The ability to identify groups of value sets is essential to
      achieving semantic interoperability and development of modular
      structures of electronic health records (EHR). Group
      identification can be used to identify, for example, all the value
      sets needed for a given purpose like filling in a particular kind
      of report.

          A Value Set must be uniquely identified to allow various
          applications and users to recognize it. When a Value Set is
          retrieved, the application or the user is retrieving a
          particular instance of it, or an <emphasis>Expanded Value
          Set</emphasis> (an Expanded Value Set is a set of concept
          representations that were in effect at a specific time for a
          particular version of a Value Set definition. The
          <emphasis>Value Set</emphasis> (definition) and the
          <emphasis>Expanded Value Set</emphasis> concepts are similar
          to the programming concepts of Class and Instance of Class.)

        <title>21.1.3 The relationship between ITI SVS and CTS </title>
<literallayout>The Value Set Repository can be supported by a system that implements a
Terminology Server using the current HL7 CTS or the upcoming HL7 CTS2 specifications. It is important to note the complementary role of the HL7 specification for CTS and CTS2, and that of the SVS Integration Profile. CTS defines an API (Application Programming Interface) supported by a terminology management service, and CTS2 defines the functionality supported by a terminology management service leaving the specification of the API to the Object Management Group. SVS defines the transmission protocols for a network access to a terminology server focused specifically on the distribution of Value Sets.</literallayout>
<literallayout>However, there is functional consistency between SVS and CTS/CTS2. More
specifically, all the properties of the Value Sets and concepts described in the
Shared Value Sets Retrieve transaction are a subset of the properties defined in
CTS and the CTS2 functional specification for the same entities. Note that SVS
supports the distribution of Value Sets containing concepts from multiple
code systems (e.g., DICOM and SNOMED issued) which is consistent with the CTS
capabilities, but which was not supported in the CTS specifications (but is supported
in the CTS2 specification).</literallayout>

            The developers of value sets may choose to work with one or
            more of these types, but the final consumers of value sets
            need to work with expanded value sets. There are efforts
            underway to develop standard methods for exchanging explicit
            definition of intensional and extensional value sets, but
            these are outside the scope of the SVS Profile. SVS provides
            only a way to distribute value sets that have been expanded.
          </para>
          <para>
            The SVS Profile also restricts the complexity of the
            expanded value sets. At present, it only supports
            unstructured value sets that are a list of codes from coded
            terminologies. Other internal structures such as hierarchy
            are not defined. This meets the needs of most, but not all,
            value sets.

          <para>
            The process and rules associated with a value set expansion
            is not specified nor constrained by this profile. It is the
            responsibility of the value set developer or of the system
            supporting the SVS Repository to perform the appropriate
            expansions. If the value set developer defines their
            standard distribution format as the expanded form of the
            value set, they have the appropriate procedures for this
            expansion. Value set developers that do not have a procedure
            defined for distributing the expanded form will need to
            establish one in order to use the SVS Profile.

            A value set developer that defines and publishes expanded
            value sets should also establish the proper identification
            that identifies either this expanded value set or the
            definition that resulted in this expanded value set. They
            also define metadata that describes the value set. (Value
            set group descriptions will be discussed later.) The
            metadata is listed below, and includes descriptive
            information, links to further explanatory material,
            effective dates, etc. The SVS Profile provides two

                other standards efforts defining forms for intensional
                and extensional value sets. These other forms are
                intended for use by value set developers. SVS provides

            A value set user that receives an intensional or extensional

            dates and the descriptive material, must be consulted to
            determine the proper use of the expanded form. In practice,
            value sets change slowly and there is usually time for human
            review and decision making about the use of the expanded

            value set developer will provide an expanded form together

          <para>
            Value sets are also described by various grouping and
            tagging mechanisms. These groupings may be defined in
            parallel by many different organizations. It is expected
            that each organization is creating groups for their own
            purpose. One organization may assign groups like “value sets
            associated with H1N1”, while another group may assign groups
            like “value sets associated with clinical trial xyz
            reports”, and a third may assign groups like “formulary for
            treatment of H1N1 influenza”. Each of these organizations
            may assign key words so that retrieval requests can find the
            relevant groups, and they may assign OIDs for these groups.
          </para>
          <para>
            To simplify maintenance, SVS defines a list of group
            descriptions to be associated with each value set, rather
            than combining all the keywords and groups from different
            organizations into a single list. The retrieval transaction
            searches all of these descriptions when doing a retrieval
            based on group keyword or group OID.
          </para>
          <para>
            An organization that is creating new groups can define a
            list of keywords and an OID for that group purpose. This
            group description can then be attached to each value set
            that should be a member of that group. If a value set needs
            to be removed from the group, then the attached description
            can be removed. This avoids accidental removal of keywords
            when multiple organizations have used the same keyword

        This section describes the process and information flow when a
        Value Set Consumer retrieves a Value Set from a Value Set
        Repository. There is no required order between the two
        transactions. The Value Set Consumer chooses whichever
        transactions and order are appropriate. The Value Set Consumer
        can use Retrieve Value Set [ITI-48] to retrieve a single value
        set based upon a known value set OID. The Retrieve Multiple
        Value Sets [ITI-60] transaction can be used to retrieve all of
        the value sets that match a selection specification. The
        selection criteria for [ITI-60] need not include a known value
        set OID.

            The CPT is a uniform coding system consisting of descriptive

              A patient is being referred by her PCP from a small
              healthcare facility to a large healthcare facility. She
              gets hospitalized and is being seen by a group of
              healthcare professionals: oncologists, laboratory
              practitioners, pharmacists, and nurses.
            </para>
            <para>
              The patient’s record will contain medical information from
              different healthcare information edge systems, such as an
              Electronic Medical Record system (EMR), a Laboratory

              All systems need up-to-date CPT codes so that seamless
              flow of encoded information results. Currently the update
              is achieved via application-specific processes on a system
              by system basis, which increases the risk of error when
              updating Value Sets in multiple systems.

            <para>
              The Discharge Summary produced by the hospital lacks coded
              information about the care received due to the lack of a
              consistent and uniform nomenclature. The document is then
              published to a regional repository or saved on a portable
              media. The PCP can then retrieve it (via XDS or XDM, for
              example).

              Due to the full lack of encoding, two potentially

              billing information will not reach the provider, or the
              medical information is not machine processable and cannot
              be incorporated in other systems, with data mining being
              compromised.

            Radiology departments or healthcare enterprises define local

            The MAWF Profile further states that a department or
            enterprise should define the code sets which are used by all
            of its systems in a common way, so that each relevant code
            set is available to each system with the same valid content.
            Each system needs to be configurable as to which code sets
            it uses. The lack of a common mechanism for distribution of
            code sets contributes to the development of local protocols
            like “<emphasis>routine screening</emphasis>”,
            “<emphasis>magnification</emphasis>”,
            “<emphasis>CAD</emphasis>”, that are understood by
            technologists or doctors, but could not be applied to
            another department or enterprise, nor by the modality in the
            scope of an automated error correction.
          </para>
          <para>
            Moreover, those codes are subject to be modified, removed,
            declared obsolete, or simply dropped. This situation is
            confusing since the RIS list of protocol codes cannot be
            fully reliable anymore.

            Despite technical means defined in the IHE Radiology
            Scheduled Workflow and Mammography Acquisition Workflow
            Profiles, variances in the way users and systems behave can
            lead to department inefficiencies, ambiguous data, special
            cases for automated billing, and less than optimal
            acquisition and reading environments.

            <para>
              A patient comes in for a scheduled standard screening
              mammogram. While the acquisition is processed, a
              suspicious lump is detected, and additional views are
              required, taken by the technologist. A diagnostic
              mammogram is performed instead of the simple routine
              screening that was scheduled. This information must be
              then communicated to the RIS, in order to change the
              billing codes and implicitly change the hanging protocol
              for the radiologist. As it is, the technologist has to
              manually change the procedure.
            </para>
            <para>
              The procedure code will have to be corrected in the RIS
              post-examination so that the correct information is
              captured, both for display and for billing purposes.

              Changing a procedure code should be done directly from the
              modality, avoiding a subsequent intervention that can
              generate errors, misunderstandings, or discrepancies. SVS
              Profile provides the modality with a mechanism for
              accessing a uniformed, centralized and dedicated Expanded
              Value Set.

              An Expanded Value Set dedicated to mammography procedure

            <para>
              The modality, acting as a Value Set Consumer, retrieves
              the Expanded Value Set commonly used by and defined for
              the mammography exams.

              The correct type of the exam is processed (or at least

          <para>
            There is a bidirectional relationship between the users of
            terminologies, codes, and value sets at one end, and the
            standards development organizations (SDOs) and other
            developers of terminologies, codes, and value sets. The
            following diagram shows the process by which terminologies
            and value sets flow up to the value set consumers. The
            users’ comments and new requirements flow back down to the
            sources of information.
          </para>
          <para>
            At the top of this diagram, the value set consumers retrieve
            values sets from a master value set repository that they
            need for particular purposes. This could be done with the
            [ITI-48] transaction when the consumer is configured with
            specific OID values for specific purposes. Often, there is a
            need to retrieve a group of value sets that share a common
            purpose, such as all of the value sets needed to populate a
            particular kind of report. These retrievals are performed
            using the [ITI-60] retrieve multiple value sets transaction.
          </para>
          <para>
            This master value set repository is subject to review and
            governance. The individual consumers have delegated
            responsibility for administering and maintaining the master
            value set repository to a coordinating organization. These
            organizations may be local, state, regional, or national
            organizations. They are typically not the developers of
            standard terminologies. The master repository organization
            serves an administrative and coordinating purpose to ensure
            that the releases of standard terminologies from SDOs do not
            interfere with daily operations of the value set consumers.
            They may also coordinate requests from value set consumers
            for new terminologies and value sets. There is a governance
            committee to coordinate these activities in both directions.
            These activities are important to the maintenance of the
            master value set repository. They are not described further
            as part of this profile.
          </para>
          <para>
            The terminology developers typically release new
            terminologies and value sets on a regular schedule or at
            times matching their process. These notifications may be via
            bulletins, electronic notification, and other processes.
            They are not covered as part of this profile. The governance
            committee may choose to use [ITI-60] as their method of
            retrieving copies of the SDO value sets, if the SDO has
            established a value set repository as part of their
            distribution process.

            There are often situations where notifications such as
            emails, bulletins, etc. contain descriptive information
            rather than a specific OID. Also, there are situations where
            potentially useful value sets must be found based upon only
            a description. An example of this kind of use is:

      <para>
        The contents handled by the SVS Profile are not patient
        specific, so there are no risks to privacy. Some Expanded Value
        Sets are of little value to an attacker as they are public
        tables of non-critical information (e.g., Expanded Value Sets
        used for coding of body parts in medical exams). Other Expanded
        Value Sets might need protection against malicious modification
        or interception.
      </para>
      <para>
        The risks applicable to the SVS Profile are discussed in the
        table “<emphasis>Risks associated with the profile
        SVS</emphasis>” which is found on the IHE ftp site in
        <emphasis>ftp://ftp.ihe.net/IT_Infrastructure/iheitiyr6-2008-2009/Technical_Cmte/Profile_Work/SharingValueSets/</emphasis>.
        The nature of the Expanded Value Set exchange determines the
        type or risk that can incur. For example, there can be integrity
        risks such as masquerade<footnote>
          <para>
            A malicious server passing for the value set repository
            gives forged value sets.
          </para>
        </footnote>, or the modification of Expanded Value Sets. Another
        possible type of risk would be at the privacy and
        confidentiality level such as the interception of an Expanded
        Value Set containing confidential data. The profile will allow
        mitigation of those risks when needed in the following manner:
      </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            A Value Sets Repository shall be grouped with an ATNA Secure
            Node or Secure Application. Since the Value Set Consumer is
            not required to be grouped with the Secure Node or Secure
            Application, the Value Set Repository shall support both
            secure and non-secure connections.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Value Set Repositories shall be able to restrict access to a
            specific Expanded Value Set to authorized and authenticated
            nodes, while allowing unauthenticated network queries to
            other Expanded Value Sets.
          </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>
            Given the wide variety of systems that will be retrieving
            Expanded Value Sets (e.g., embedded medical device versus
            PACS) the profile does not mandate that the Value Set
            Consumer be grouped with an ATNA Secure Node or a Secure
            Application. Depending on local risk assessment, local
            policy may mandate such grouping.

        The actors in this profile are the same as the actors defined in
        the PIX Profile (Section 5.1). Figure 23.1-1 shows the actors
        directly involved in the Patient Identifier Cross-referencing
        HL7 V3 Integration Profile and the relevant transactions between
        them. Other actors that may be indirectly involved due to their
        participation in other related profiles are not shown.

        Table 23.1-1 lists the transactions for each actor directly
        involved in the Patient Identifier Cross-referencing Profile. In
        order to claim support of this Integration Profile, an
        implementation must perform the required transactions (labeled
        “R”). Transactions labeled “O” are optional. A complete list of
        options defined by this Integration Profile and that
        implementations may choose to support is listed in the Section
        23.2.

        <title>23.2.1 Pediatric Demographics Option</title>
        <para>
          The experience of immunization registries and other public
          health population databases has shown that matching and
          linking patient records from different sources for the same
          individual person in environments with large proportions of
          pediatric records requires additional demographic data.
        </para>
        <para>
          In particular, distinguishing records for children who are
          twins, triplets, etc. – that is, avoiding false positive
          matches - may be difficult because much of the demographic
          data for the two individuals matches. For instance, twin
          children may have identical last names, parents, addresses,
          and dates of birth; their first names may be very similar,
          possibly differing by only one letter. It can be very
          difficult for a computer or even a human being to determine in
          this situation whether the slight first name difference points
          to two distinct individuals or just a typographical error in
          one of the records. Additional information is extremely
          helpful in making this determination.
        </para>
        <para>
          Pediatric Demographics makes use of the following six
          additional demographic fields to aid record matching in
          databases with many pediatric records.

                  These fields, although not strictly demographic, can
                  effectively substitute when multiple birth indicator
                  and birth order are not collected. They indirectly
                  provide visit information. Provider visits on the same
                  day may likely indicate two children brought to a
                  doctor together.

        The patient identifier in HL7 V3 messages is represented by the
        II data type. This data type has two components: a root, and an
        extension. For compatibility with the use of patient identifiers
        in profiles using HL7 V2 messages, and with the specification of
        the patient identifier in the XDS Profile, the patient
        identifier SHALL be represented as a root and an extension,
        where the root is an appropriately assigned OID. The direct
        correspondence between the II data type and the HL7 Version 2.5
        CX data type (used in field PID-3) is shown in ITI TF-2x:

        <para>
          The experience of immunization registries and other public
          health population databases has shown that matching and
          linking patient records from different sources for the same
          individual person in environments with large proportions of
          pediatric records requires additional demographic data.
        </para>
        <para>
          In particular, distinguishing records for children who are
          twins, triplets, etc. – that is, avoiding false positive
          matches - may be difficult because much of the demographic
          data for the two individuals matches. For instance, twin
          children may have identical last names, parents, addresses,
          and dates of birth; their first names may be very similar,
          possibly differing by only one letter. It can be very
          difficult for a computer or even a human being to determine in
          this situation whether the slight first name difference points
          to two distinct individuals or just a typographical error in
          one of the records. Additional information is extremely
          helpful in making this determination.

          Pediatric Demographics makes use of the following six

                  provide visit information. Provider visits on the same
                  day may likely indicate two children brought to a
                  doctor together.

            There are needs to aggregate data so that a pattern can
            emerge, but the patients’ identities need not to be known.
            For example, CDC (The Center for Disease Control and
            Prevention) or the InVS in France would like to know how
            many cases of A1H1 are present at a national level at one
            point in time. In this case, there is no need to identify
            the patient, and unless other data is necessary to establish
            a trend (such as age, for example); an aggregated query on
            the metadata <emphasis>eventCodeList</emphasis> is
            sufficient using the <emphasis>ObjectRefs</emphasis> query.
            In this case irreversible pseudonymization or anonymization
            can be used since the data is employed statistically to

            There are other cases where statistical analysis in
            semi-real time is desired, such as an aggregated query at a
            district level to do profiling by region in times of an
            influenza epidemic. Again, this is a situation where the
            patient’s identity is not needed, but the number of cases
            and perhaps certain parameters such as the date. In order to
            be able to perform the aggregated queries, there has to be a
            minimum data set as per HIPAA recommendations.

          The output of a Multi-Patient Query can be in one of two
          forms: a list of opaque identifiers, each identifying a

            Opaque identifiers, known in XDS as ObjectRefs, are useful
            to: discover the number of matches in the registry and then
            possibly to later retrieve the full metadata for the
            matching registry content. Applications that need only
            statistics (counts) can count the returned identifiers. Note
            that these identifiers represent documents (for example)
            that match the query and not patients. A single patient
            could have multiple matching documents.

            A Multi-Patient Query can return full metadata, known as
            LeafClass in XDS. This metadata includes Patient Ids and
            patient demographics from potentially multiple patients so
            it is difficult to protect yet must be protected. Because of
            this sensitivity this type of return result would likely be
            only allowed by very highly trusted systems and thus this
            query is likely not to be available as widely as others.

      <para>
        <emphasis>The security and privacy considerations arise because
        this profile allows for a single query to result in multiple
        patients XDS metadata to be returned in one transaction.
        Although the XDS metadata is not high-grade health data it is
        still identifiable health information and thus needs to be
        protected. The combination of multiple patient’s protected
        information in the same result results in a more difficult task
        to assure that the intended recipient has all the authorizations
        necessary for the intended use. In classical XDS queries the
        query request/response is constrained to a single patient and
        therefore the access control decision can be done across the
        whole transaction.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>This profile allows for two different types of return
        result. The ObjectRef result can be used to limit the exposure
        as this result will return only opaque identifiers of the
        matching documents. It is expected that this result would be
        more widely allowed. The Document Consumer can still obtain the
        full metadata but must use the classic XDS queries on an
        object-by-object basis thus allowing for transactions that are
        constrained to a single patient. This additional set of
        transactions to retrieve the metadata may be unnecessary when
        the system doing the query is authorized to use the LeafClass
        response. For example, when the querying system is known as a
        system that will protect the information to the same degree.
        Where it is known that this querying system will apply the
        appropriate access control prior to ultimate use or

          This profile describes the use of subscription and
          notification mechanisms for use within an XDS Affinity Domain
          and across communities. The subscription allows for the
          matching of metadata during the publication of a new document
          for a given patient, and results in the delivery of a
          notification.
        </para>
        <para>
          If a system can implement the Document Metadata Notification
          Recipient, it can be directly notified using a push-style
          method.

            <para>
              A patient in the emergency department has all her relevant
              available documents retrieved via XDS transactions. As
              initial triage of the patient is done, an additional
              document regarding diagnostic results for this patient is
              registered in the XDS Document Registry. Currently, there
              is no way for the Emergency department to learn about the
              existence of this new information. With a
              publish/subscribe infrastructure, the initial query to the
              XDS Document Registry would be accompanied with a
              subscription request, as a result of which a notification
              would be sent to the emergency department. The
              subscription will be terminated once the patient is no
              longer under the care of the emergency department's
              institution.

              A patient visits his PCP after being discharged from a
              hospital that belongs to the same XDS Affinity Domain as
              the provider's organization. The provider sends a query to
              the XDS Document Registry, and retrieves the hospital
              discharge summary. The patient also has follow-up visits
              with a specialist at the hospital, and these visit
              summaries (including diagnostic test results) are
              registered in the XDS Document Registry. Currently, the
              PCP would have to periodically query the Document Registry
              for documents about the patient in order to retrieve the
              follow-up visit summaries. With a publish/subscribe
              infrastructure, the PCP would have a subscription for all
              his patients, so that notifications would have been
              received as the summaries were registered in the XDS
              Document Registry.

                      During the 40 weeks of a typical pregnancy
                      duration, the patient will have an initial History
                      and Physical Examination, followed by repetitive
                      office visits with multiple laboratory studies,
                      imaging (usually ultrasound) studies, and serial
                      physical examinations with recordings of vital
                      signs, fundal height, and the fetal heart rate. As
                      the patient is seen over a finite period in the
                      office, aggregation of specific relevant data
                      important to the evaluation of the obstetric
                      patient upon presentation to Labor and Delivery is
                      captured on paper forms. The antepartum documents
                      contain the most critical information needed

              Dr. Brown is a clinician and can request exams for many
              patients. His system can create a subscription for
              documents produced that are intended for him (the
              subscription created has the intendedRecipient as filter
              parameter).

            <para>
              Mr. White attends a consultation with Dr. Brown, who
              requests a Laboratory Report for the patient. The EMR
              system creates a subscription with an intendedRecipient of
              Dr. Brown.
            </para>
            <para>
              The patient receives the exam in a Clinical Laboratory.
              The Laboratory Information System produces a report and
              submits the document in the Document Sharing
              Infrastructure identifying Dr. Brown as intendedRecipient
              for the submission. This publishing event matches the
              existing subscription and a notification is sent by the
              Document Metadata Notification Broker to Dr. Brown’s
              system (identified as Document Metadata Notification
              Recipient in the subscription created). Dr. Brown can
              quickly analyze the report published and can make other
              clinical decisions in an efficient way.

            In this use case a clinician creates a subscription for a
            specific instance of workflow (e.g., eReferral Workflow)
            because he wants to be notified of any updates that occurred
            to the workflow. The workflow Id is stored in the metadata
            XDSDocumentEntry.ReferenceIdList.

            <para>
              Dr. Brown is a GP. He decides to refer his patient Mr.
              White to another healthcare provider to have a
              specialist’s consultation. Dr. Brown does not take part in
              subsequent steps of the Referral process, but he wants to
              be notified of any relevant progress related to the
              workflow. Mr. White calls the specialist, Dr. Green, to
              schedule the specialist consultation. Dr. Brown is
              notified of this event.
            </para>
            <para>
              On the day of the visit, the patient is admitted in Dr.
              Green’s office. Dr. Green analyzes the referral request
              created by Dr. White and any useful Clinical Documents
              related to the request. When the visit is completed, Dr.
              Green publishes a report and Dr. Brown is notified of the
              completion of the eReferral process so that he can analyze
              the whole workflow and all related documents.

              <title>26.4.2.5.1.1 Technical Aspects (Workflow Id and
              XDSDocumentEntry ReferenceIdList subscription)</title>
              <para>
                The eReferral process is managed and tracked by the
                creation of a specific Workflow Document (e.g., as
                defined in the IHE PCC Cross-enterprise Basic eReferral
                Workflow Definition Profile (XBeR-WD)). The Workflow
                Document has a unique fixed reference, the workflow Id,
                which is stored in the XDSDocumentEntry.ReferenceIdList
                metadata.
              </para>
              <para>
                The GP’s system creates this Workflow Document and a
                related subscription that identifies the specific
                workflow Id as filter parameter for the creation of
                notifications. From this time, any update of the
                workflow document will result in the creation and the
                delivery of a notification to the GP, because the
                Workflow Id remains the same during the whole evolution
                of the workflow. For example, the scheduling phase
                involves the creation of a new version of the Workflow
                Document characterized by the same workflow Id. This
                scheduling event triggers the creation of a notification
                that is sent to the GP.
              </para>
              <para>
                The execution of the visit involves another update of
                the workflow document and, as consequence, a new
                notification is sent to the GP.
              </para>
              <para>
                This notification framework allows the GP to be active
                participant in the process started by him.

        The risk analysis for this profile enumerates assets, threats,
        and mitigations. The risk assessment spreadsheet is stored and
        available from IHE at
        <link xlink:href="http://wiki.ihe.net/images/4/46/DSUB_risk_assesment.xls">http://wiki.ihe.net/images/4/46/DSUB_risk_assesment.xls</link>.

      <para>
        The purpose of this risk assessment is to notify implementers of
        some of the risks that they need to consider in implementing
        DSUB actors. For general IHE risks and threats please see ITI
        TF-1: Appendix L. The implementers are also advised that many
        risks cannot be mitigated by the IHE profile and instead the
        responsibility for mitigation is transferred to the implementer,
        and occasionally to the XDS Affinity Domain and enterprises. In
        these instances, IHE’s responsibility to notify affected parties
        is fulfilled through the following section.
      </para>
      <para>
        A policy decision can be made during the Subscribe transaction,
        whether the subscription is an authorized subscription and
        whether a notification/type of notification is authorized. (This
        could be based on the XUA identity, the consumer address value,
        etc.)
      </para>
      <para>
        This profile does not include the solution to changes of policy
        between the subscribe time and notify time (which can be
        substantial). The recommendation is that the policy is enforced
        conservatively (i.e., the length of subscription can be
        determined by the Document Metadata Notification Broker). An
        approach allows the access of content published in accordance to
        consent given by the patient. The consent is dynamic and can
        change during time. The availability of content can be
        discovered only asking the document-sharing infrastructure. The
        creation of subscription is not dependent to access policies
        rules. If the Document Metadata Notification Broker sends the
        references, then the control of access policies is in
        query/retrieve transactions of the Document Metadata
        Notification Recipient.

      The Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD) Profile supports the
      means to locate communities that hold patient relevant health data
      and the translation of patient identifiers across communities
      holding the same patient’s data. A community is defined as a group
      of facilities/enterprises that have agreed to work together using
      a common set of policies for the purpose of sharing health
      information within the community via an established mechanism.
      Facilities/enterprises may host any type of healthcare application
      such as EHR, PHR, etc. A community is identifiable by a globally
      unique id called the homeCommunityId. Membership of a
      facility/enterprise in one community does not preclude it from
      being a member in another community. Such communities may be XDS
      Affinity Domains which define document sharing using the XDS
      Profile or any other communities, no matter what their internal
      sharing structure.

          <para>
            The Initiating Gateway supports all outgoing inter-community
            communications. XCPD uses this actor to initiate the Cross
            Gateway Patient Discovery [ITI-55]. The Initiating Gateway
            is required to support synchronous transaction messaging and
            may declare an option to support Asynchronous Web Services
            Exchange. Choosing Asynchronous Web Services Exchange will
            allow the Initiating Gateway to support workflows which
            scale to large numbers of communities because Asynchronous
            Web Services Exchange allows for more efficient handling of
            latency and scale.

            The Responding Gateway supports all incoming inter-community
            communications. XCPD uses this actor to receive the Cross
            Gateway Patient Discovery [ITI-55] transaction. The
            Responding Gateway is required to support Asynchronous Web
            Services Exchange on all implemented transactions. This
            allows the Initiating Gateway to choose the better of the
            two messaging patterns (synchronous or asynchronous) that
            fit the needs of the workflow. Support for Asynchronous Web
            Services Exchange allows for workflows which scale to large
            numbers of communities because it can handle latency and
            scale more efficiently.

            The Cross Gateway Patient Discovery transaction supports the
            ability for Initiating Gateways and Responding Gateways to
            discover mutually known patients. This transaction assumes
            an environment where patient data is well described and
            high-quality demographic data is available.
          </para>
          <para>
            Because the transaction supports the mutual discovery of
            patients it can be seen as having dual purposes.

            This dual nature of the transaction is chosen for
            scalability purposes, as demographic matching algorithms are
            expensive on a large scale and once a match is identified it
            is important that both the initiating and responding sides
            of the transaction can use the results of that successful
            match.

          The Deferred Response Option reflects the more detailed
          understanding and feedback from implementers regarding
          processing that may result in significant delay. The
          Asynchronous Web Services Exchange Option (WS-Addressing
          based) can support some scenarios with delayed response but
          not environments where the delay in responding may be as much
          as days or weeks. These cases require a mechanism that is
          managed by the application and which supports recovery through
          system restart. Deferred Response mode provides applications
          with such capability. In doing so it also adds
          responsibilities to the application, in particular for
          managing message correlation, creating application level
          acknowledgements and determining where to send a Deferred
          Response message. The new flexibility allowed by the Deferred
          Response Option is deemed worthy of these additional
          requirements on the application. For more information about
          Deferred Response and Asynchronous messaging in general see

          <emphasis role="strong">Use Case: Multiple primary
          residences</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          This use case describes the situation where a patient
          maintains more than one principal residence. Generally, the
          principal residences are not geographically close so the
          medical data generated while in each residence would be
          created by separate institutions.
        </para>
        <para>
          A common example of this use case is what is described in the
          United States as the Snow Bird. This is a person who maintains
          two residences, one in the northern part of the USA for use
          during the hot summer months and one in the south for the
          colder winter. If a patient lives in Florida in the winter and
          in New York in the summer, this patient will likely have
          medical records in both places which need to be shared. If the
          patient is managing a long-term medical condition, like
          diabetes, it will be important as she moves from New York to
          Florida and back that the background and related testing
          associated with management of the medical condition is readily
          accessible to the local physician.

          <emphasis role="strong">Use Case: Border towns</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          A variation of the multiple primary residence use case
          involves a patient who lives on the border between two
          communities or works and lives at some distance. A patient who
          lives in Longwy, France, which is on the border between the
          France and Belgium, may access health facilities both in
          France and Belgium. If that patient works in the European
          Investment Fund, he might also access health organizations in
          Luxembourg. All of these disparate areas, although closer
          geographically than the two French cities Longwy and Toulouse
          would probably hold patient information in separate domains
          thereby requiring the same kind of cross domain sharing as the
          snowbird case described above.

        <para>
          Due to the peer-to-peer nature of XCPD interactions the

          possible approaches are:

        <para>
          The patient carries an identification card which points to a
          Patient Medical Home. The Initiating Gateway uses the
          identification of the Patient Medical Home to determine the
          correct Responding Gateway to contact.

          A nation supports a registry of communities which can be

          communities. When seeing a patient with a known home address a
          community may search the registry for communities near that
          home address and contact those first.

          Prior to any point-to-point sharing of protected health data

            Figure 27.3.2.2-1 shows the flow when an Initiating Gateway
            interacts with a Responding Gateway which is representing
            multiple organizations and reflecting those organizations in
            its Cross Gateway Patient Discovery response. The Responding
            Gateway interacts, using a community internal mechanism or
            any standard mechanism (e.g., XCPD, PDQ), with each of the
            Master Patient Indices (MPI) to find a match for the
            specified demographics. The figure shows the Responding
            Gateway interacting with three MPI’s and discovering three
            matching patient identifiers: X in the A domain, Y in the B
            domain and Z in the C domain. All three of the patient
            identifiers are returned in the Cross Gateway Patient
            Discovery response in a way that indicates that they
            represent three different domains, rather than three matches
            from one domain (which is also possible and coded in a
            different way see ITI TF-2b: 3.55.4.2.2.4). In order for the
            Initiating Gateway to access all data it must issue three
            separate XCA Cross Gateway Query transactions, each with one
            of the patient identifiers returned from the Cross Gateway
            Discovery transaction.

          The Cross-Enterprise Document Workflow (XDW) Profile enables
          participants in a multi-organizational environment to manage
          and track the tasks related to patient-centric workflows as
          the systems hosting workflow management applications
          coordinate their activities for the health professionals and
          patients they support. XDW builds upon the sharing of health
          documents provided by other IHE profiles such as XDS, adding
          the means to associate documents conveying clinical facts to a
          patient-specific workflow. XDW provides a common
          interoperability infrastructure upon which a wide range of
          specific workflow definitions may be supported. It is designed
          to support the complexity of health services delivery with
          flexibility to adapt as workflows evolve.

          tasks as they move through the associated workflow. The
          Workflow Document also maintains the references to health
          information input and output associated with each task. Such

                The first layer supports the sharing or exchange of
                documents. This interoperability foundation is enabled
                by a set of existing IHE document sharing profiles such
                as XDS, XDR and XDM along with document content profiles
                and security/privacy profiles such as ATNA and
                (optionally) BPPC;

                The second layer defines a generic data structure called
                a Workflow Document which is shared among the workflow
                participants by using the first layer of this
                architecture. Likewise, the clinical and administrative
                documents that are used as input and produced as output
                by the tasks of workflows managed by the XDW Profile are
                shared using the same first layer of this architecture;

                The third layer introduces the semantic definition of
                the workflows that can be understood and executed among
                the participating systems/applications. The
                orchestration of specific workflows allows the workflow
                participants to share a common understanding of the
                specific tasks, the dependencies between these tasks,
                and a number of rules that control the workflow
                execution. Execution details are conveyed through the
                XDW Workflow Document defined by the second layer of the
                architecture. The specification of Workflow Definitions
                at this third layer is not part of the XDW Profile and
                is currently best handled with a natural language
                expression (See example of Basic Unstructured Workflow
                Definition Profile, ITI TF-2x: Appendix X);

                The fourth layer of this architecture contains the
                applications executed by the participating systems. Such
                applications bridge between XDW managed workflow and the
                locally managed workflow. Much of the details of the
                local workflows managed by each application will be
                hidden and encapsulated in “higher” granularity tasks
                exposed through XDW; as such details would not need to
                be externally exposed. The workflow definitions conveyed
                by the third layer should only contain higher
                granularity tasks that require workflow coordination
                across organizational boundaries.

            At any time, if a participant chooses to update the workflow
            for a specific patient, it shall either create one (or more)
            new task or update an existing task and record a past
            taskEvent. Each update to the Workflow document results in a
            new instance of the Workflow Document which is published as
            a replacement. The prior version being replaced is then
            placed in the status “deprecated” (DocumentEntry
            availabilityStatus) so that only the newest Workflow
            Document is active. The technical description of the

            When a new Workflow Document is created, the Content Creator
            assigns it a workflow identifier in the

            workflow document. This workflow identifier does not change
            during the evolution of the workflow itself, and allows the
            grouping of all the XDW Workflow Documents that belong to
            the same instance of workflow.
          </para>
          <para>
            All subsequent replacement workflow documents also carry the
            same workflow identifier so that this identifier provides a
            stable reference to an instance of a workflow, while the
            Workflow Document DocumentEntry.uniqueId is different for
            each version of the workflow document.

        that organizations will replace documents authored by other
        organizations, as typically a clinical document comes from only
        one organization or individual. Therefore in order to adhere to

      The Document Digital Signature (DSG) Profile defines general
      purpose methods of digitally signing of documents for
      communication and persistence. Among other uses, these methods can
      be used within an IHE Document Sharing infrastructure (e.g., XDS,
      XCA, XDM, XDR, and MHD). There are three methods of digital
      signature defined here: Enveloping, Detached (manifest), and

          An Enveloping Signature is a Digital Signature Document that
          contains both the signature block and the content that is
          signed. Access to the contained content is through removing
          the Enveloping - Digital Signature. Among other uses, this
          method should not be used with Document Sharing
          infrastructure.

          A Detached Signature is a Digital Signature Document that
          contains a manifest that points at independently managed
          content. Detached signatures leave the signed document or
          documents in the original form. Among other uses, this method
          is recommended for use with a Document Sharing infrastructure
          to support Digital Signatures, as this method does not modify
          the original Document Content. This method uses the Document
          Sharing “SIGNS” relationship provides linkage.

        assure content integrity, authenticity, and authentication of
        the identity of the signer. The identity of the signer is

        <title>37.4.1 Verify Document Integrity</title>
        <para>
          One purpose of use of a Digital Signature is to verify that
          the document being used is the same as the document that was
          signed and has not been modified by error or intent. This is
          called establishing document integrity. Document signatures
          may be used to establish document integrity; that is, to
          verify that the current document is the same as the signed
          document, and it has not been modified by error or intent.
          Document signatures may also be used to ascertain the identity
          of the signer and the reason for signing.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, to confirm that a document is a true copy of a
          source medical document, the digital signature is checked. If
          the signature is verified, then the document is a true copy.
          If the signature does not verify, then the document has been
          modified.
        </para>
        <para>
          Another purpose of use is to verify the clinical content of a
          document. When a physician has verified that a report is
          complete and correct, the physician signs the document with
          purpose of signature being “verification”. If there is ever a
          need, the digital signature provides a mechanism to show that
          the “verification” was attested to by the physician.
        </para>
        <para>
          For example, a clinician who needs to rely on a document which
          was created by another clinician may use a signature to
          ascertain that the version they are using has been verified.

    <title>Appendix D: User Authentication Techniques - Passwords,

    <para>
      Authentication techniques are based on one or more of three
      factors: Something you know, something you are, or something you
      have. There are many different authentication techniques in use
      today. The technologies supporting these techniques are not well
      standardized. There are also excellent security reasons to avoid
      specifying any single set of technologies for authentication use.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Kerberos protocol was originally defined to work with any user
      authentication technique. Kerberos has been shown to support a
      wide variety of authentication technologies. These include various
      forms of tokens and biometric technologies. Specific
      implementations of these technologies often include proprietary
      components. There is often a pair of proprietary components added
      – one at the user workstation and a matching component at the
      authentication server. Once the user authentication is complete,
      the subsequent Kerberos transactions are the same.
    </para>
    <para>
      These extensions are not yet standardized. The IHE specification
      for the use of Kerberos does not prevent the use of these
      extensions at a specific site, nor does it ensure that the
      extensions will work.
    </para>
    <para>
      The Kerberos system specified for the Enterprise User
      Authentication utilizes a challenge response system together with
      a username and password system to authenticate the user. The
      minimal support of passwords provides a standardized baseline for
      the IHE “Enterprise User Authentication”. Kerberos enables
      enforcement of a central password policy which facilitates
      stronger passwords. Such password policies are beyond the scope of
      IHE. Kerberos does not prevent the use of weak passwords. The
      password strength policy must be chosen and enforced by the site
      security administration.

      Both XDR and XDM describe the exchange of a set of patients’
      documents. They are relevant in situations where XDS is not yet
      implemented or available at one of the participating organizations
      or where point-to-point (versus sharing through a registry)
      interaction is desired.

    <para>
      XDM is applicable in situations where the information receiver is
      an individual who will manually interpret or examine the data and
      associated documents. XDM allows for one exchange which contains
      documents relating to multiple patients and can be used in
      situations where no continuous networking capability is available
      on one or both of the participating healthcare providers.

      XDR is applicable in situation where the information exchanged is
      going to an automated application or robust system capable of
      automated storage or process of documents relative to one patient.
      XDR requires continuous networking capability between the
      healthcare providers exchanging data.

      <para>
        Both profiles are document content neutral, conveying documents
        without modification and managing the same set of metadata. They

        But they do differ in some important ways. XDS is a centralized

        and Recipient).

        Integration Profiles in this domain, Patient Identifier
        Cross-Referencing (PIX) and Patient Demographics Query (PDQ).
        The description in this section is only at a high level and more

        This diagram present a basic approach relying on the existing
        IHE Patient Demographics Query (PDQ) Integration Profile by the
        Initiating and Responding Gateways, where the Responding Gateway
        respond to queries with patient demographics traits for
        potential patients in the community it serves, thus allowing
        Initiating Gateways to obtain the patient Id to use in the Cross
        Gateway Query. The result of this transaction would be a) zero,
        indicating the patient does not have records at that community
        b) one, indicating the gateway was able to uniquely identify the
        patient c) multiple, indicating the Responding Gateway was not
        able to uniquely identify the patient. In the case of a) or b)
        the transaction is complete and does not require human
        intervention. If multiple results are returned this requires
        human intervention to resolve.
      </para>
      <para>
        This approach requires a significant number of policy decisions
        to be in place, coordinated with privacy consent in
        cross-community environment that are well beyond the scope of
        the combined use of PDQ and XCA presented in Figure E.10.2-1. In
        addition, the integration of a large number of communities with
        a large number of non-overlapping patient populations is likely
        to require addressing significant scaling issues in allowing
        Responding Gateways to process the requests for identity
        resolution.

      IHE does not mandate the use of encryption because the performance
      impact of current encryption algorithms is excessive. Most
      hospital networks provide adequate security through physical and
      procedural mechanisms. The additional performance penalty for
      encryption is not justified for these networks. The profiles
      permit the use of encryption so that it can be used as part of an
      overall security plan.

    <title>Appendix J: Content and Format of XDS Documents</title>
    <para>
      The XDS Integration Profile purposely leaves a number of policies
      up to the XDS Affinity Domain to decide, including the structure
      and format of the content of XDS Documents to be shared, the
      mapping of content metadata into the XDS Document Registry, the
      coding of XDS Document metadata, the events that trigger an XDS
      Submission Request, and the policies concerning the use of XDS
      Folders to facilitate sharing.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is important to recognize that until sufficient experience has
      been gained in cross-enterprise document sharing, it is not
      possible to establish common or even best practices in the use of
      the XDS Integration Profile. IHE has therefore chosen to abstain
      to make recommendations in these topics at this time.
    </para>
    <para>
      IHE also recognizes that there will be a need for content-oriented
      integration profiles to be used in cooperation with this
      Integration Profile. It is expected that in the future the various
      IHE Domains (Patient Care Coordination, Cardiology, Laboratory,
      Radiology, IT Infrastructure, etc.) will produce IHE Integration
      Profiles refining the use of XDS within the domain. These various
      content-oriented integration profiles may rely on XDS, but would
      further constrain the forms of documents to be shared, or the uses
      of XDS features such as Folders and Submission Sets, et cetera.
    </para>
    <para>
      Content Neutrality
    </para>
    <para>
      XDS is content neutral. It neither prescribes nor prohibits the
      format, content, structure or representation of documents that can
      be retrieved from an XDS Document Repository. For the XDS
      Integration Profile to have immediate value to an XDS Affinity
      Domain, it must be able to adapt to the documents that are present
      and available from its members. Thus, prohibitions on content
      would only serve to limit the utility and adoption of the XDS
      Integration Profile. Similarly, XDS Affinity Domains must be able
      to adapt to emerging standards, which cannot be enumerated in any
      list of prescribed content formats.
    </para>
    <para>
      IHE strongly recommends that XDS Affinity Domains adopt rules that
      require documents to comply with widely accepted standards where
      possible (<emphasis>e.g.</emphasis>, HL7 CDA, CEN ENV 13606, ASTM
      CCR, and DICOM Composite Object).
    </para>
    <para>
      Document Headers and Metadata
    </para>
    <para>
      Because XDS is content neutral, XDS cannot validate metadata
      contained within the body of an XDS document against the metadata
      supplied to the XDS Document Registry. XDS Affinity shall
      therefore select content where IHE has defined Integration
      Profiles, or until that point, the XDS Affinity Domains shall
      carefully define how the attributes in the XDS Document Registry
      are filled.
    </para>
    <para>
      Metadata and the Patient Record
    </para>
    <para>
      Although metadata in the document header may be duplicated in the
      XDS Document Registry, the XDS Document Registry metadata has a
      particular role in term of being part of the legal medical record
      stored. It is definitively not part of the clinical record as
      managed by the XDS Document Repositories where documents reside.
      Furthermore, XDS does not provide for transactions to “sign” or
      legally authenticate the content of an XDS Submission Set (see the
      Document Digital Signature Profile (DSG), although it offers the
      ability to track its author, if the XDS Affinity Domain so desires
      to enforce it. The contents of XDS Folders are tracked, through
      the Submission Sets that contributed to placing document
      references in folders. However, the existence of document metadata
      in the registry and the potential medical acts involved in
      creating an XDS Submission Set or XDS Folder may make the contents
      of the XDS Document Registry part of the patient’s legal medical
      record. It will be up to individual XDS Affinity Domains to decide
      how to address the issues involved with these clinical acts and to
      resolve them in accord with common sense, acceptable medical
      practices, and local regulations.

      In order to reduce the number of unique identifiers associated

    <title>Appendix L: XDS Affinity Domain Definition Checklist</title>
    <para>
      The concept of an XDS Affinity Domain is defined in ITI TF-1:10
      and ITI TF-1: Appendix K. ITI TF-1: Appendix L originally provided
      an informative checklist for the key policies that need to be
      addressed in order to deploy an EHR-LR document sharing
      environment for an XDS Affinity Domain. However, it was recognized
      that this checklist was incomplete as it did not deal with many
      necessary XDS Affinity Domain deployment issues. In order to
      address these shortcomings, a new “Template for XDS Affinity
      Domain Deployment Planning” White Paper has been created:
      <link xlink:href="http://ihe.net/Technical_Frameworks/#IT">http://ihe.net/Technical_Frameworks/#IT</link>
    </para>
    <para>
      It takes the form of a template rather than a checklist because it
      acts more as an outline for all the issues that should be
      considered, rather than a checklist to be used to verify the
      correctness of a particular implementation. This new template can
      be used when defining policies for either an individual XDS
      Affinity Domain, or multiple XDS Affinity Domains within a
      particular nation or region.

    <title>Appendix M: Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing and IHE
    Roadmap</title>
    <para>
      The IHE Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing Integration Profile is
      part of a family of IHE Integration Profiles grouped in a number
      of domain-specific Technical Frameworks Patient Care Coordination,
      Cardiology, Laboratory, Radiology, IT Infrastructure, etc.). XDS
      is a central foundation for Cross-Enterprise interoperability that
      may be combined with a number of the existing IHE Integration
      Profiles (see ITI TF-1: Appendix E). However, a number of new IHE
      Integration Profiles need to be developed, pending the
      availability of the relevant base standards.

    <para>
      <anchor id="_Toc214425706" /><emphasis role="strong">M.1 Document
      Content Integration Profiles for XDS</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      It is expected that the various IHE Domains (Cardiology,
      Laboratory, Radiology, IT Infrastructure, etc.) will produce new
      IHE Integration Profiles addressing the content of the documents
      that need to be shared. These various “content-oriented”
      Integration Profiles will rely on the XDS Integration Profile for
      managing the registration, discovery and access processes in a
      common manner.
    </para>
    <para>
      Such an effort is underway with the IHE Patient Care Coordination
      Domain for medical summaries used in referrals and discharge
      summaries and other document types. See
      <link xlink:href="http://www.ihe.net/">www.ihe.net</link>.

      Cross-Enterprise Dynamic Information Sharing</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      The management of dynamic information (non-document-oriented) such
      as allergy lists, medication lists, problem lists, etc. is not
      addressed by XDS. However, a means to access this information in a
      structured form and to manage updates to such dynamic clinical
      information is a candidate for a specific Integration Profile.

      Collaborative Workflow Process Management</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      There is a wide array of shared care delivery collaborative
      processes such as the placing and tracking of orders (e.g., drug
      prescriptions, radiology orders, etc.) for which XDS provides only
      a partial solution (the creation of the patient record with the
      resulting persistent artifacts). XDS offers a critical
      infrastructure for ePrescribing and eReferral in that it can
      ensure that the various providers share access to orders,
      prescriptions, dispensations, and results. The means to
      interoperate on the command/control part of these collaborative
      workflow processes is a candidate for specific Integration
      Profiles in the future.

      <anchor id="_Toc214425709" /><emphasis role="strong">M.4 Security
      and Privacy Management</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      The operation of any XDS Affinity Domain will require that a
      proper security model be put in place. It is expected that a range
      of security models should be possible. Although the XDS
      Integration Profile is not intended to include nor require any
      specific security model, it is required that XDS implementers
      group XDS Actors with actors from the IHE Audit Trail and Node
      Authentication Profile and will need an Access Control capability
      that operates in such a cross-enterprise environment. Specific IHE
      Integration Profiles complementary to XDS are available (e.g.,
      Cross-Enterprise User Authentication, Document Digital Signature,
      etc.).

      Federation of XDS Affinity Domains</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      XDS is an effective means to establish XDS Affinity Domains that
      include care delivery organizations at any level, local, regional
      or national. However, the establishment of independent but
      consistently XDS Affinity Domains will call for their federation,
      as patients expect their records to follow them as they move from
      region to region, or country to country. IHE foresees a need for
      transferring information from one XDS Affinity Domain to another,
      or to allow access from one XDS Affinity Domain to documents
      managed in other XDS Affinity Domains. XDS has been designed with
      this extension in mind. The Cross-Community Access (XCA)
      Integration Profile that complements XDS provides this function.

    <para>
      This Appendix provides information about when consent could be
      automated and consequently when the BPPC Profile could be used.
      Privacy consent can be summarized as: &quot;I agree on my personal
      data being disclosed to someone under specific conditions&quot;.
    </para>
    <para>
      Conditions are based on various factor(s) for example:

      BPPC could be used when conditions can be described with a limited

      easily interpreted by a Document Consumer implementing the Basic
      Patient Privacy Enforcement Option.

      Each instance of the matrix results in a single Patient Privacy
      Policy. This vocabulary must then be configured in the XDS
      Affinity Domain. Thus configuring each application in the XDS
      Affinity Domain to recognize for each Patient Privacy Policy
      identified, and which sensitivity (confidentialityCode); what
      types of accesses are allowed. Using the example above, the
      Patient Privacy Policy might look like.

      It has also been suggested that documents should simply be
      published with the expected codes, and that only on use of a
      document that ALL current Patient Privacy Policy Acknowledgements
      are evaluated against with the code on the document. In this way
      revocation is more dynamic.
