<p>The concept of an XDS Affinity Domain is defined in ITI TF-1:10 and ITI TF-1: Appendix K. ITI TF-1: Appendix L originally provided an informative checklist for the key policies that need to be addressed in order to deploy an EHR-LR document sharing environment for an XDS Affinity Domain. However, it was recognized that this checklist was incomplete as it did not deal with many necessary XDS Affinity Domain deployment issues. In order to address these shortcomings, a new “Template for XDS Affinity Domain Deployment Planning” White Paper has been created: <a href="http://ihe.net/Technical_Frameworks/#IT">http://ihe.net/Technical_Frameworks/#IT</a></p>
<p>It takes the form of a template rather than a checklist because it acts more as an outline for all the issues that should be considered, rather than a checklist to be used to verify the correctness of a particular implementation. This new template can be used when defining policies for either an individual XDS Affinity Domain, or multiple XDS Affinity Domains within a particular nation or region.</p>
