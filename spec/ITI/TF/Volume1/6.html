<h1 id="patient-synchronized-applications-psa-1">Patient Synchronized Applications (PSA)</h1>
<p>The <em><strong>Patient Synchronized Applications Profile (PSA)</strong></em> enables single patient selection for the user working in multiple applications on a workstation desktop. With this Integration Profile patient selection in any of the applications causes all other applications to tune to that same patient. This allows a clinician to use the application they are most familiar with to select the patient and have that selection reflected in the other applications they are using follow along.</p>
<p>This profile leverages the HL7 CCOW standard, specifically for patient subject context management. The scope of this profile is for sharing of the CCOW Patient subject only. The IHE PSA Profile adds value to the CCOW specification for the patient subject by further constraining the patient identifier to ensure consistency across applications supporting PSA, providing guidance for consistent behavior across applications supporting PSA and ensuring consistent interaction with the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Consumer across the enterprise.</p>
<p>For applications that require user authentication, IHE recommends implementation of the Enterprise User Authentication Profile, as opposed to other means, such as a CCOW Authentication Repository. Section 4 describes the Enterprise User Authentication (EUA) Profile and the use of the CCOW user subject.</p>

<p>Table 6.1-1 lists the transactions for each actor directly involved in the PSA Profile. In order to claim support of this Integration Profile, an implementation must perform the required transactions (labeled “R”).</p>
<p>The Patient Context Participant shall support all four transactions identified in Figure 6.1-1 as defined in ITI TF-2a. The Patient Context Participant shall respond to all patient context changes. This actor shall set the patient context provided the application has patient selection capability.</p>
<p>The IHE Context Manager may encompass more than a CCOW context manager function. It may include a number of other components such as the context management registry and patient mapping agent.</p>
<p>The Context Manager may be grouped with a Patient Identifier Cross-referencing (PIX) Consumer of the Patient Identity Cross-referencing Profile; see ITI TF-2x: Appendix D for a description of the additional responsibilities placed on the Context Manager in this case.</p>

<h2 id="patient-synchronized-applications-integration-profile-process-flows">Patient Synchronized Applications Integration Profile Process Flows</h2>
<p>The Patient Synchronized Applications Integration Profile provides maximum value when a user needs to use more than one application simultaneously. The process flow outlined in Section 6.3.1 depicts a use case where the applications only participate in the PSA Profile. The process flow outlined in ITI TF-1: Appendix E illustrates when the PSA and Enterprise User Authentication (EUA) Profiles are deployed together.</p>
<h3 id="use-case-simple-patient-switching"><strong>Use Case: Simple Patient Switching</strong></h3>
<p>When an actor in the PSA Profile is not grouped with an actor in the EUA Profile only the patient identity is passed in context. This use case does not explicitly identify the method of user authentication, as it may not be required by the application or may be accomplished by other means. In this use case both applications share the same patient identifier domain. The process flow for this use case is:</p>
<p>The clinician launches the clinical data repository application, depicted as Patient Context Participant Actor 1. The clinical data repository application joins the context session for the clinician desktop.</p>
<p>The clinician selects patient A in the clinical data repository application. The clinical data repository application sets the identifier for patient A in context.</p>
<p>The clinician launches a cardiology application, depicted as Patient Context Participant Actor 2. The Cardiology application joins the context session, gets the identifier for patient A from context, and tunes its display to patient A.</p>
<p>The clinician selects patient B in the cardiology application. This action results in the initiation of a Change Context transaction by the cardiology application (Patient Context Participant Actor 2). All non-instigating applications participate via the Follow Context transaction, which results in the selected patient being displayed in the clinical data repository application (Patient Context Participant Actor 1).</p>
<p>The clinician closes the clinical data repository application. The clinical data repository application leaves the context prior to terminating the application.</p>
<p>The clinician closes the cardiology application. The cardiology application leaves the context prior to terminating the application.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3-1 illustrates the process flow for this use case.</p>

<h1 id="consistent-time-ct-1">Consistent Time (CT)</h1>
<p>The <em><strong>Consistent Time Integration Profile</strong></em> <em><strong>(CT)</strong></em> provides a means to ensure that the system clocks and time stamps of the many computers in a network are well synchronized. This profile specifies synchronization with a median error less than 1 second. This is sufficient for most purposes.</p>
<p>The Consistent Time Integration Profile defines mechanisms to synchronize the time base between multiple actors and computers. Various infrastructure, security, and acquisition profiles require use of a consistent time base on multiple computers. The Consistent Time Profile requires the use of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) defined in RFC1305. When the Time Server is grouped with a Time Client to obtain time from a higher tier Time Server, the Time Client shall utilize NTP. For some Time Clients that are not grouped with a Time Server, SNTP may be usable.</p>
<p>This profile was previously a portion of the Radiology Basic Security Profile, but it has a variety of other infrastructure uses.</p>
<p>Note: This profile corresponds to a portion of the IHE Radiology Technical Framework, Basic Security Profile (now deprecated). It is required by more than just radiology systems. It is needed by several of the profiles in the IHE IT Infrastructure and will also be needed by Cardiology. It is therefore being re-located from IHE Radiology into IHE IT Infrastructure. There are no changes to the requirements, so actors that supported the Radiology Basic Secure Node or Time Server do not need modification.</p>

<h2 id="consistent-time-process-flow">Consistent Time Process Flow</h2>
<p>This section describes the typical flow related to the Consistent Time Profile. In the process flow Figure 7.3-1, the Time Client B and Time Server B have been grouped. When a Client and Server are grouped, they utilize internal communications mechanisms to synchronize their time.</p>
<p>Figure 7.3-1: Basic Process Flow in Consistent Time Profile</p>
<p>The Time Client B maintains time synchronization with the Time Server A. The Time Server B is internally synchronized with Time Client B. The Time Client C maintains time synchronization with Time Server B.</p>
<p>The NTP protocol has been designed to provide network time services for synchronization with this kind of cascaded synchronization. The achievable accuracy is dependent on specific details of network hardware and topology, and on details of computer hardware and software implementation. The Time Server and Time Client are grouped to provide synchronization cascading and reduce network traffic.</p>
