This has been proposed as a potential new-work-item to IHE IT-Infrastructure.

The Publication is available on the [Basic Audit - FHIR continuous build](http://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/BasicAudit/branches/main/index.html)

The [BasicAudit GitHub repo is available](https://github.com/JohnMoehrke/BasicAudit)
